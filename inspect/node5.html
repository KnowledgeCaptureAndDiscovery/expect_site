 <H1><A NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000">5 Types of Problems Detected by INSPECT</A></H1>
<P>
As explained above, INSPECT embeds a library of problems in air
campaign plans. These problems (sometimes referred to as <EM>
  inconsistencies</EM>) can be classified in two ways. The first
distinguishes categories of problems by their significance or
seriousness. The second distinguishes categories of problems by areas
or aspects of the plan they are related.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00050010000000000000">Categories of problems distinguished by seriousness</A></H4>
<P>
In order to indicate the significance or seriousness of the
problems found by INSPECT, we define three types of
problems corresponding to the usage of the terms in Air Force
manuals:
<P>
<UL><LI> <EM>Warning</EM> -- this is a serious problem, that requires
  urgent attention.<LI> <EM>Caution</EM> -- this is a reasonably serious problem, that
  requires some attention but not immediately.<LI> <EM>Note</EM> -- this is a less serious problem, that does not
  require immediate attention.
</UL>
<P>
Each type of problem checked by INSPECT belongs to one of these
categories. They are displayed in the INSPECT agenda ordered from the
most serious to the less serious, i.e., first warnings, then cautions,
then notes.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00050020000000000000">Categories of problems distinguished by aspects of the plan</A></H4>
<P>
The problems in INSPECT's library can be divided into four main types,
distinguished based on major aspects of the plan:<A NAME="tex2html4" HREF="footnode.html#153"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.isi.edu/~valente/images/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
<DL ><DT><STRONG>Completeness</STRONG>
<DD> These are problems that relate to the completeness
  of the plan, i.e., whether some element or connection between
  elements is missing. In this group there are currently five
  problems:
<P>
  <UL><LI> <EM>Objective with no child</EM> (Caution). According to the
    strategy-to-task approach to air campaign planning, all objectives
    must be subordinated to higher objectives (their ``parents'') and
    decomposed into lower objectives (their ``children''). This
    problem occurs when there is an objective that was not
    decomposed into objectives of a lower level.<LI> <EM>Objective with no parent</EM> (Warning). This problem occurs
    when there is an objective that is not serving any higher level
    objective.<LI> <EM>Objective with no MOM (measure of merit)</EM> (Note).
    According to the strategy-to-task approach to air campaign
    planning, all objectives must contain a measure of merit (MOM)
    that defines in measurable terms when the objective has been
    achieved. This problem occurs when there is an objective for
    which no measure of merit was defined.<LI> <EM>Objective with no structured specification</EM> (Note). In
    order to maintain consistency in the way objectives are written,
    it is preferable that they are specified also in the structured
    language defined for this IFD-4, and implemented in a special ACPT
    editor. Further, this structured specification enables systems
    like INSPECT to interpret and better understand the semantics of
    the objectives, therefore enabling automation of several tasks
    relative to air campaign plans. This problem occurs when there is
    an objective for which no structured specification was provided.<LI> <EM>No objective fulfilling one of the basic tenants of air
      power</EM> (Caution). Air Force doctrine suggest that an air
    campaign plan must contain objectives of certain types, related to
    the so-called ``basic tenants of air power''. These tenants are:
    force deployment, force protection, air superiority, force
    application, conflict termination, and force redeployment. This
    problem occurs when one of the basic tenants of air power is not
    fulfilled by any objective in the entire plan.
    </UL>
<P>
  <DT><STRONG>Reasonable structure</STRONG>
<DD> This type of problem relates to
    the fact that the structure of the plan must obey certain
    standards. Specifically, two types of problems are
    currently checked:
<P>
  <UL><LI> <EM>Objective with too many parents</EM> (Note). An objective
    with too many parents is an indication that the parent objective
    is either too general (and should thus be divided) or the
    connections are somewhat artificial.<A NAME="tex2html5" HREF="footnode.html#58"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.isi.edu/~valente/images/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A> This problem
    occurs when there is an objective with more than three parents.<LI> <EM>Incompatible sequence restrictions</EM> (Warning). Sequence
    restrictions specify when a given objective should (or must) be
    accomplished before or after other objectives. This problem
    occurs when one sequence restriction specifies that an objective
    should or must be accomplished before another, and another
    sequence restriction specifies the opposite.
  </UL>
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Feasibility</STRONG>
<DD> This type of problem examines some broad
  aspects of the feasibility of the plan (more detailed aspects are
  verified by e.g. SIPE in IFD-4).
<P>
  <UL><LI> <EM>No primary aircraft currently available for an Objective</EM>
    (Note). For each type of aircraft, there is a limited number of
    types of missions it is suited to execute, and a few types it was
    primarily designed to execute. This problem occurs when an
    objective requires a type of mission that is not the primary
    mission type of any of the aircraft available in the Friendly
    Order of Battle.<LI> <EM>No adequate aircraft currently available for an
      Objective</EM> (Caution). This problem occurs when an
    objective requires a type of mission for which none of the
    aircraft currently available in the Friendly Order of Battle is
    adequate.
  </UL>
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Plan contents</STRONG>
<DD> This type of problem analyzes the semantics
  of the plan contents (e.g. the definition of the objectives).
<P>
  <UL><LI> <EM>Incoherent decomposition</EM> (Warning). In principle, an
    objective must be decomposed into objectives which are more
    specific or more detailed than their parent. This problem occurs
    when a parent objective is more specific than one of its child
    objectives.<A NAME="tex2html6" HREF="footnode.html#67"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.isi.edu/~valente/images/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>

Appendix A provides examples of agenda items, fixes and explanations
for each of the types of problems discussed above.
