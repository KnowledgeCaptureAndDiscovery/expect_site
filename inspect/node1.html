<P>
This document describes and discusses INSPECT <A NAME="tex2html1" HREF="footnode.html#8"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.isi.edu/~valente/images/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A> (INtelligent System for air
campaign Plans Evaluation based on expeCT). INSPECT is a
mixed-initiative planning support tool that critiques/evaluates
ACPlans (Air Campaign Plans) by checking their consistency with
respect to several dimensions. The description in this document should
not be taken as a full specification or documentation of INSPECT, but
as an overview of what it does.
<P>
INSPECT was built using the EXPECT knowledge acquisition framework and
system. EXPECT provides tools to construct knowledge-base
applications. It was designed to allow non-programmers to modify an
application, while freeing them from the need to understand
implementation details.
<P>
INSPECT was presented in the Fourth Integrated Feasibility
Demonstration (IFD-4) of ARPI. The system is part of a Technology
Integration Experiment (TIE) between EXPECT and the Air Campaign
Planning Tool (ACPT) to provide consistency checking for strategic
plans developed (or modified) using ACPT. ACPT is a system that allows
editing and browsing ACPlans. It contains several tools to help in the
planning process, and it allows access to several other applications
that support the planning process.
<P>
INSPECT can be invoked from ACPT after a user has finished editing the
air objectives and/or air tasks of an ACPlan. INSPECT's knowledge base
contains knowledge about a library of commonly occurring planning
problems. INSPECT examines a user's plan to see if any of the problems
in the library can be found. If so, it notifies the user and explains
the problem to him. Presently, this verification of consistency is
done almost entirely by manual methods, since ACPT automates only a
few checks (e.g., detection of redundant targets).  INSPECT extends
ACPT's current capabilities by automating several other types of error
checking in air campaign plans.

Knowledge acquisition was a critical task in building INSPECT, and
demanded much effort from the experts. Many thanks to all Checkmate 
members who interacted with us, and most especially to Colonel
Plebanek, who allowed us to have this interaction, Major Cardenas, for
coordinating the knowledge acquisition sessions, and to the
Checkmate members we used as experts and worked with closely: Major
Allison (``Coach''), Major Alred (``Yogi''), Major Cardenas, Major
Cunico, and Major Jackson (``J.J.''). Their support to our work and
their patience in answering our questions has been vital to this
effort. We hope they like the results.
