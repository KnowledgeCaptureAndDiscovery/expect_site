<P>
The main benefit of this application is to improve and assure the
quality of the air campaign plans, by detecting (potentially
dangerous) problems before the plan is sent to execution. INSPECT
extends the capabilities of ACPT by providing users with an
interactive plan consistency checking tool. Currently ACPT allows
users to edit plans without providing any support to check the
validity of the plan during high-level plan development. It also
simplifies the process of checking the plan in each stage of
development. INSPECT captures knowledge that experienced planners use
in critiquing air campaign plans and thus helps a user improve the
quality of his plans by finding problems and oversights that commonly
occur in air campaign plans and reduce their quality. Another benefit
of using INSPECT is to help users plan effectively in crisis
situations, when the time pressures make it very hard to manually
check the consistency of all the alternative plans that are considered
for a given crisis, each one changing as the crisis evolves. In
addition to raising the floor on plan quality, we also anticipate that
INSPECT will have benefits for training: through using INSPECT, users
will understand better the process of planning and the kinds of
problems that can arise in producing an air campaign plan.
