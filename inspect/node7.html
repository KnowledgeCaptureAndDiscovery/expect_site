        <PRE>INSPECT is checking plan completeness. One step in doing
that is to determine whether objectives have been decomposed into
tasks. Objective &quot;Protect US citizens abroad&quot; has not been decomposed
into tasks.

POSSIBLE CAUSES AND FIXES TO CONSIDER
(OTHER CAUSES AND FIXES MAY BE POSSIBLE):

- Air tasks for this objective have not been linked to it yet.
  POSSIBLE FIXES:
    - Link one or more existing air tasks to this objective.

- Air tasks have not been defined yet for this objective.
  POSSIBLE FIXES:
    - Define air tasks for this objective and link them.

- Dismiss item: Air tasks do not need to be provided for this objective.
  NOTE: Choosing this option is unusual. If this option is selected,
        the system will request a justification.</PRE>

<PRE>Air task &quot;Defend Allied forces from TBM Attack&quot; is not serving any air
objective.</PRE>
    <DT><STRONG>Explanation</STRONG>
<DD>  <BR> 
      
        <PRE>INSPECT is checking plan completeness. One step in doing
that is to determine whether tasks are serving objectives. Objective
A9 (&quot;Defend US forces from TBM Attack during phase II and III&quot;) is not
serving an objective.

POSSIBLE CAUSES AND FIXES TO CONSIDER
(OTHER CAUSES AND FIXES MAY BE POSSIBLE):

- The air objectives for this air task have not been linked to it yet.
  POSSIBLE FIXES:
    - Link one or more existing air objectives to this air task.

- The air objectives have not been defined yet for this air task.
  POSSIBLE FIXES:
    - Define air objectives for this air task and link them.

- Dismiss item: Air objectives do not need to be provided for this air
  task. 
  NOTE: Choosing this option is unusual. If this option is selected,
        the system will request a justification.</PRE>

<PRE> Air Objective &quot;Destroy Libyan political control of armed forces&quot; has
 no measure of merit.</PRE>
    <DT><STRONG>Explanation</STRONG>
<DD>  <BR> 
      
        <PRE>INSPECT is checking plan completeness. One step in doing
that is to check objectives for assessment of completion. Objective
&quot;Destroy Libyan political control of armed forces&quot; has no assessment
of completion because it has no measure of merit.

POSSIBLE CAUSES AND FIXES TO CONSIDER
(OTHER CAUSES AND FIXES MAY BE POSSIBLE):

- A measure of merit for the objective has not been defined yet.
  POSSIBLE FIXES:
    - Add a measure of merit to the objective.

- Dismiss item: Objective does not have a measure of merit.
  NOTE: Choosing this option is unusual. If this option is selected,
        the system will request a justification.</PRE>

<PRE>Objective &quot;Ensure Air/Sea lines of communications remain open&quot; does

    <DT><STRONG>Explanation</STRONG>
<DD>  <BR> 
      
        <PRE>INSPECT is checking plan structure. One step in doing
that is to check that objectives have a structured specification. C4
(&quot;Ensure Air/Sea lines of communications remain open&quot;) has no
structured specification.

POSSIBLE CAUSES AND FIXES TO CONSIDER
(OTHER CAUSES AND FIXES MAY BE POSSIBLE):

- It is not clear how to define the objective with the editor.
  POSSIBLE FIXES:
    - Try to restate the objective using a different verb.
    - Try to break the objective into two or more objectives
      (e.g., gain and maintain).

- Dismiss item: It was impossible to define the objective with
     the existing editor.
  NOTE: Choosing this option is unusual. If this option is selected,
     the system will request a justification. The system will also
     automatically send a report that there is a problem with the
     editor.</PRE>

  <DL ><DT><STRONG>Agenda Item</STRONG>
<DD>  <BR> 
<PRE>There is no air objective that fulfills &quot;Force Redeployment&quot;.</PRE>
    <DT><STRONG>Explanation</STRONG>
<DD>  <BR> 
      
        <PRE>INSPECT is checking all phases of the Integrated Air Operations Plan
(IAOP) for completeness. One step in doing that is to check that the
plan fulfills all components of an IAOP. INSPECT is now checking for
an objective that fulfills &quot;Force Redeployment&quot;. To do that, INSPECT
looks for an objective of the following kinds: redeploy, and prepare
for redeployment.

POSSIBLE CAUSES AND FIXES TO CONSIDER
(OTHER CAUSES AND FIXES MAY BE POSSIBLE):

- Objectives fulfilling the component of redeployment have not been
  defined yet. 
  POSSIBLE FIXES:
    - Add one or more objectives fulfilling the missing component.

- Only some of the phases of the plan have been defined, and the
  missing component would be fulfilled in the missing phases.
  POSSIBLE FIXES:
    - Define phases that are missing from the plan and fulfill the
      component. 

- Dismiss item: Tenant does not need to be fulfilled.
  NOTE: Choosing this option is unusual. If this option is selected,
        the system will request a justification.</PRE>

<DD>  <BR> 
<PRE>Air objective &quot;Maintain air superiority over AOR&quot; is linked to six
CINC Objectives.</PRE>
    <DT><STRONG>Explanation</STRONG>
<DD>  <BR> 
      
        <PRE>INSPECT is checking plan structure. One step in doing that is to check
for reasonable decomposition. Objective &quot;Maintain air superiority over
Tunisia and Libya&quot; may be an unreasonable decomposition because it
serves more than 3 CINC objectives.

POSSIBLE CAUSES AND FIXES TO CONSIDER
(OTHER CAUSES AND FIXES MAY BE POSSIBLE):

- The objective may be too broad as defined.
  POSSIBLE FIXES:
    - Replace objective with better defined, more specific
      objectives. 

- This may have been done as a way to force a high priority to this
  air objective. 
  POSSIBLE FIXES:
    - Assign a higher priority to this air task and select the
       most appropriate links to CINC objectives.

- The objective is serving too many CINC objectives by mistake.
  POSSIBLE FIXES:
    - Select the most appropriate links to CINC objectives.

- Dismiss item: This air objective serves many CINC objectives.
  NOTE: Choosing this option is unusual. If this option is selected,
        the system will request a justification.</PRE>

<PRE>&quot;Drive Libyan forces into desired chokepoints and restricted LOCs&quot; and
&quot;Disrupt movement of Libyan forward corps and 2nd echelon forces&quot; have
inconsistent time restrictions.</PRE>
    <DT><STRONG>Explanation</STRONG>
<DD>  <BR> 
      
        <PRE>INSPECT is checking plan structure. One step in doing that is to check
plan consistency. INSPECT is now verifying that the time restrictions
are consistent. The temporal restrictions on &quot;Drive Libyan forces into
desired chokepoints and restricted LOCs&quot; and &quot;Disrupt movement of
Libyan forward corps and 2nd echelon forces&quot; are not consistent
because the first objective must occur before the second objective and
the second must occur before the first.

POSSIBLE CAUSES AND FIXES TO CONSIDER
(OTHER CAUSES AND FIXES MAY BE POSSIBLE):

- There are contradictory constraints that may need to be fixed.
  POSSIBLE FIXES:
    - Reconsider ordering of objectives and then change the time
      restrictions. 

- One of the restrictions was defined by mistake.
  POSSIBLE FIXES:
    - Delete one of the sequence restrictions.</PRE>

<PRE>&quot;Destroy Enemy Naval activity in the Western Sea&quot; implies a mission of
type &quot;anti-submarine warfare&quot;. The only assets that have this mission
as a primary mission are the aircraft A6, F3 and S3. None of these are
currently available in the friendly AOB. [Alternative, non-primary,
aircraft for this type of mission are: F-18.]</PRE>
    <DT><STRONG>Explanation</STRONG>
<DD>  <BR> 
      
        <PRE>INSPECT is checking plan feasibility. One step in doing that is to
check that primary aircraft are available. &quot;Destroy Enemy Naval
activity in the Western Sea&quot; is a mission of type &quot;anti-sumbarine
warfare&quot;.  The primary aircraft for this type of mission are A6, F3
and S3, which are not available in the friendly AOB.

POSSIBLE CAUSES AND FIXES TO CONSIDER
(OTHER CAUSES AND FIXES MAY BE POSSIBLE):

- Objective was not defined correctly
  POSSIBLE FIXES:
    - Modify the objective so that it does not require the asset.
    - Delete the objective.

- friendly AOB as defined in the system is not up to date.
  POSSIBLE FIXES:
    - Update the friendly AOB.

- Availability of this asset is crucial for plan to succeed.
  POSSIBLE FIXES:
    - Report to the JFACC a request for this asset.

    <DT><STRONG>Explanation</STRONG>
<DD>  <BR> 
      
        <PRE>INSPECT is checking plan feasibility. One step in doing that is to
check that suitable aircraft are available. Air Task &quot;Destroy Enemy
Naval activity in the Western Sea throughout conflict&quot; is a mission of
type &quot;anti-submarine warfare&quot; and &quot;naval surface warfare&quot;. Suitable
aircraft for this mission are an F-18, a B-52, an A6, and a P-3, but
none of these is currently available in the friendly AOB.

POSSIBLE CAUSES AND FIXES TO CONSIDER
(OTHER CAUSES AND FIXES MAY BE POSSIBLE):

- Objective was not defined correctly

<PRE>Air Objective &quot;Destroy Weapons of Mass destruction capability of
Lybia&quot; is a child of the CINC Objective &quot;Destroy Lybian special
weapons delivery vehicles&quot;, but the CINC Objective is more specific
than the Air Objective.</PRE>
    <DT><STRONG>Explanation</STRONG>
<DD>  <BR> 
      
        <PRE>It seems unusual to specify the Air Objective &quot;Destroy Weapons of Mass
destruction capability of Lybia&quot; as a child of the CINC Objective
&quot;Destroy Lybian special weapons delivery vehicles&quot;. In principle, a
CINC Objective must be more general than its children Air Objectives.
However, this CINC Objective is more specific than this Air Objective,
since &quot;special weapons delivery vehicles&quot; is more specific than
&quot;Weapons of Mass destruction capability&quot;.

POSSIBLE CAUSES AND FIXES TO CONSIDER
(OTHER CAUSES AND FIXES MAY BE POSSIBLE):

- The link between the objectives was created by mistake.
  POSSIBLE FIXES:
    - Delete the link between the objectives.

- One (or both) of the objectives was mistakenly defined.
  POSSIBLE FIXES:
    - Correct the definition of the objectives so that the child is
      more specific than the parent.
    - Delete the objective.
