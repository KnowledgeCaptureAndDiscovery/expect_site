Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node4.html#figinspectarch">1</A> displays the architecture of INSPECT.
The system takes the following inputs:
<P>
<UL><LI> <EM>An air campaign plan stored in ACPT.</EM> The plan does not
  need to be complete. However, since many of the problems in
  INSPECT's library refer to completeness, INSPECT may detect an
  inordinate number of errors in draft plans. Also, for several of its
  checks, INSPECT relies on the availability of structured
  descriptions of the objectives according to the grammar proposed in
  another related document and incorporated in an extended objectives
  editor in the IFD-4 version of ACPT [<A HREF="node8.html#Valente96b">Valente <EM>et al.</EM>, 1996</A>]. If those
  descriptions are not available,<A NAME="tex2html3" HREF="footnode.html#18"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.isi.edu/~valente/images/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A> INSPECT's evaluation capability
  may become severely limited.<LI> <EM>The friendly order of battle (FOB).</EM> The FOB contains
  information on the units available for the campaign. This
  information is used to check, for instance, if all the types of
  aircraft needed for executing the plan are effectively available.

<STRONG>Figure 1:</STRONG> The architecture of the INSPECT system.<BR>
<P>
<P>
Future versions of INSPECT will use other inputs, such as the Enemy
Order of Battle (EOB, which contains information about enemy targets),
measures of measure (MOM, also known as measures of effect or MOE),
Rules of Engagement (RoE) and Commander's Guidance.
<P>
INSPECT produces as output an <EM>agenda</EM> of items which represent
problems or inconsistencies detected in the plan. The INSPECT agenda is
presented to the user, who need to revise and eventually solve the
problems indicated.
<P>
INSPECT is seamlessly integrated with ACPT. As a result, INSPECT does
not interact directly with the user (an air campaign planner); all
interfacing is done through ACPT. The version of ACPT demonstrated in
IFD-4 contains a new menu for controlling INSPECT that submits a plan
to INSPECT and controls a window for displaying an agenda with the
problems detected by INSPECT. Further, it has a specific window for
specifying several preference parameters for INSPECT's operation, such
as which types of inconsistencies INSPECT will report. Technical
details about the integration of INSPECT and ACPT can be found in
section&nbsp;<A HREF="node6.html#integration">6.1</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00041000000000000000">4.1 The Role of EXPECT</A></H2>
<P>
As shown in figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node4.html#figinspectarch">1</A>, INSPECT is a
knowledge-based system created by EXPECT. INSPECT includes a knowledge
base (entered through EXPECT) of plan evaluation criteria that it uses
to analyze air campaign plans. EXPECT provides support for acquiring
knowledge about new criteria and changing existing knowledge. The main
advantage of using EXPECT to build INSPECT is to achieve adaptability.
To continue to be useful, INSPECT must be adaptable. Over time, it
will be desirable to expand its library of problems and modify it as
new techniques and military technologies become available. In
addition, since INSPECT will be used in different theaters, it may be
necessary to modify INSPECT's knowledge base to handle a particular
campaign. In either case, we would like expert planners to be able to
make these changes themselves, thus reducing their need to rely on
programmers.
<P>
The EXPECT framework, which was used to construct INSPECT, was
designed to allow non-programmers to modify a system, while freeing
them from the need to understand implementation details.  The key idea
behind EXPECT is that it captures important information about how a
knowledge-based system was put together and uses this info to guide a
user in modifying the knowledge base. In the case of INSPECT, this
empowers planning experts to change the system and thus helps assure
that it will grow and remain relevant and useful in the years to come.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00042000000000000000">4.2 Scope of INSPECT</A></H2>
<P>
The following are assumptions that restrict the scope of the current
version of INSPECT. Most were introduced to make feasible the effort
of building a version of the system for IFD-4, and can be raised for
future versions.
<P>
<UL><LI> INSPECT detects inconsistencies in Air Objectives and Air Tasks.
  It may be able to check some aspects of CINC's Objectives.  Some
  inconsistencies can easily be extended for other levels of the plan,
  while others would require a specific knowledge acquisition effort.<LI> INSPECT does not try to find problems in the global strategy
  used by the planner in constructing the air campaign plan. Instead,
  it tries to find local errors and mistakes. In other words, INSPECT
  concentrates on the product (the air campaign plan) instead of the
  process (of producing this plan). As a consequence, many of the
  errors INSPECT tries to find have a ``grammatical' flavor.
  Therefore, the current version of INSPECT can be compared roughly to
  a spell and grammar-checker for air campaign plans.<LI> INSPECT does not guarantee that all the errors it finds are
  actual mistakes in the plan. This is due to the limitations in the
  current knowledge about air campaign plans: what looks like an error
  may be in fact a creative (and unusual) solution used by a planner.
  The last word on what is correct or good in ACPlans is always that
  of the experts in the Air Force.<LI> Using INSPECT does not create the best plan. INSPECT does not
  try to evaluate the quality of a plan with respect to the campaign
  it is related to and its goals, but rather concentrates on the
  quality of the <EM>formulation</EM> of the plan.<LI> INSPECT only finds the errors that are in its library of types
  of plan problems. This means that an error not in the library will
  most likely pass undetected.
</UL><H2><A NAME="SECTION00043000000000000000">4.3 Future Extensions</A></H2>
<P>
Within the same concept (consistency of an air campaign plan) several
extensions of INSPECT can be proposed:
<P>
<DL ><DT><STRONG>Evaluate doctrine</STRONG>
<DD> The system can be extended to evaluate which
  aspects of the doctrine are being followed and which are not. This
  evaluation can be used in a proactive way, i.e. would not only have
  available a report of the evaluation of the plan doctrinewise, but
  would allow the user to e.g. ask what changes can be made to
  improve the plan in terms of doctrine.
<DT><STRONG>Commander's guidance</STRONG>
<DD> The system can be extended to evaluate
  whether or not the current plan is consistent with the policies and
  guidance defined by the commanders (CinC/JFACC).
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
These extensions have been discussed with Checkmate during the design
of INSPECT. They explore the idea that some of the critiquing they
would do can be seen in a way as a consistency verification.
