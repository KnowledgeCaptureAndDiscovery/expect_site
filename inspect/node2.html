<P>
ARPI adopts a mixed-initiative approach to develop an Air Campaign
Plan. Thus, humans will be necessarily involved in the process, either
constructing or modifying the plan. However, air campaign planning
usually occurs under severe pressure and time restrictions. Several
alternative plans are constructed before and during a campaign.  The
development of the campaign requires constant modification of existing
plans. Further, an air campaign plan is normally developed by teams
working separately in parts or sections of the overall plan. All these
factors lead to the introduction of errors or inconsistencies in the
air campaign plan. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully evaluate
and check these plans.
<P>
However, evaluating air campaign plans is a difficult task. A
realistic air campaign plan comprises hundreds of objectives
structured hierarchically, and thousands of targets. It is thus very
difficult to verify if all these objectives are correct and coherent.
Further, it is also difficult to abstract `aggregate' information,
that takes into account the plan as a whole. As a result, it is almost
impossible to evaluate and compare plans manually in an efficient way.
<P>
These factors make clear the need for systems that are able to check
the consistency and correctness of air campaign plans, as well as to
evaluate them over several dimensions. INSPECT is designed to address
these needs by providing an automated and easily modifiable ACPlan
consistency-checker and evaluator.
