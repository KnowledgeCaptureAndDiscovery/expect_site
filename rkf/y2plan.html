These are the topics that we would like to work on next year.  The emphasis
will be on the first two (Dialog Management and Expression Composer), which
are aimed at making the interaction with the user more natural and flexible.

(Powerpoint slides that describe our plan are available
<A HREF="pi-mtg-10-01/dm-rkf-pi-meeting.ppt">
http://www.isi.edu/expect/projects/rkf/dm-rkf-pi-meeting.ppt</A> (10/15/01).)

<p>
We'd like to develop a dialogue manager that uses KA plans to keep 
track of the user's actions and can make suggestions for how to 
proceed.  The dialogue manager would support: 1) generation, to 
suggest to the user what to do next based on the library of KA plans, 
2) recognition, to track what the user is doing in terms of the KA 
plans.  The dialogue state would be shown to the user as a "status" 
window, where the user could see the currently active KA plans as a 
list of bullets and sub-bullets, each bullet would be checked if 
completed and collapsed when all its sub-bullets are completed.  The 
user could choose to toggle between a "suggest" mode (generation) and 
a "comment" mode (recognition).  We could also keep a history of the 
user's sessions, and be more forceful to impose the "suggest" mode to 
new users or when a more experience user tries a new 
feature/capability of the system.

<p>
A new capability that we'd like to support with this work is 
meta-level interaction with the user.  By allowing users to 
manipulate/edit the status window, they could indicate whether a 
certain task is completed (e.g., I'm done adding sub-steps).

<p>
To develop the library of KA plans we would draw ideas from 
Intelligent Tutoring Systems, in effect trying to make SHAKEN a 
smarter student.  An initial (old) outline is posted at 
 <A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/~gil/rkf/ITS.ppt">
http://www.isi.edu/~gil/rkf/ITS.ppt</A>.  For example, ITS often start by 
showing the student the purpose of a lesson, partly to give the 
student a roadmap but also to detect any gaps in the student's prior 
knowledge assumed by the lesson.  There are many other interesting 
points about controlling nested subdialogues, teaching strategies, 
providing immediate feedback, etc.

<p>
An intriguing possibility is to use this as a way to 
determine/compare the quality of human tutors by looking at how and 
how much they complete the KA plans (how organized their lessons are, 
how thorough with details), and eventually to train human tutors 
through practicing with the system.

<p>
We have done some previous work in this area on KA Scripts and 
PSMTool, several papers are available at 
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/expect/link/papers-ka.html">

<B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>2. EXPRESSION COMPOSER </B></FONT></I>

<p>
We have already built an Expression Composer (EC) that works with the
EXPECT English editor, which sparked quite a bit of interest when we
demoed it in Tucson.  Our current EC takes an expression that the user
types such as "max airport landing" and shows the user precise
expressions based on the exact representation of those terms in the KB,
such as "find the maximum of the available landing distance of the
runways of the airport" (see
<a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/rkf/composer.ppt">
http://www.isi.edu/expect/rkf/composer.ppt</a>). 
We'd like to integrate it with SHAKEN and KM, and extend it to support
not only KB search but also search/expansions on a CMAP to support
faster knowledge entry.  Another extension would be to use
lexical/linguistic resources such as thesauri (our SME dictionary and
others).

<p>
A very important new area that this would allow us to embark on is 
helping a user teach the system techno-speak, i.e., domain-specific 
vocabulary that will make the student use more technical terms to 
describe what was learned.  this is something human teachers do once 
the student has conceptually understood the material, and we can see 
that SHAKEN this past year was built to do that part of understanding 
the material but had no facilities to let a user teach it to speak in 
domain terms proficiently.

<B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>3. SADL </B></FONT></I>

<p>
The first version of the SADL language for specifying process 
structures was produced last year (see 
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/expect/rkf/action-language.html">
http://www.isi.edu/expect/rkf/action-language.html</A>).  All SMEs 
pointed out that they would have liked to express concurrent events 
and iteration, which were included in the language but only a subset 
of it (SADL-Lite) made it to SHAKEN.

<p>
A first step is to move SHAKEN from SADL-Lite to full SADL.  Many 
pieces are already done, we just need to integrate them and make it 
happen.

<p>
We also need to extend the language, some of the issues were 
described in (see <A
HREF="http://www.isi.edu/expect/rkf/action-language.html">
http://www.isi.edu/expect/rkf/action-language.html</A>
) and included an important set of extensions to accomodate the 
execution/simulation of components (UMass).

<p>
We will work with SRI to update it as needed.  KANAL already supports 
most of SADL.  For those of you who have not had a chance to see the 
latest version, it had a much improved interface and included 
documentation.  A slide demo can be downloaded from 
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/expect/projects/KANAL/">
