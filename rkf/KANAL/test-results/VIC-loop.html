<font color="green">SHAKEN simulates your process model and checks several things:<p>
<li>Check what happens before and after each step (the conditions and effects
of each step) by running a simulation
<br>e.g.: before executing Attach, check if virus is located near the cell
<br>   after Breach the plasma membrane of the cell is broken
<li>Check that all the overall <b>expected effects</b> (specified by you) are obtained
<br>e.g.: after virus-invade-cell, viral-nucleic-acid is located in the
cytoplasm
<li>Check correctness of <b>assumptions</b> (especially initial conditions)
<br>e.g., no location was specified for the virus, I'll assume it is next to the
cell
<li>Check combinations of substeps (execution paths) that are possible
<li>Check steps that are never reached during simulation
<li>Check how each step enables other steps to take place
<li>Check if there are loops

<hr>

For each of these checks, SHAKEN will report
<li>checks and assumptions that seemed ok
<li>errors,i.e., serious problems that you should fix.</font>
 <font color="red"> Errors are shown in<b>Red</b></font><font color="green">.
<li>warnings/notes, i., e., things it wants you to take a look at so you decide
for yourself whether there is a problem or not). </font><font color="orange">Warnings and notes are
shown in <b>Orange</b></font><font color="green">.
<p>
For each error or warning, you can ask SHAKEN to show you a list of
suggestions for how to fix them.  You can pick one of these suggested fixes,
or you can decide to fix the problem in a different way.  SHAKEN will take
you to the knowledge editor window in either case.</font><hr>
