Helping end users build and check process models is a challenge for many
science and engineering fields.  Many AI researchers have investigated useful
ways of verifying and validating knowledge bases for ontologies and rules, but
it is not easy to directly apply them to checking process models.  Other
techniques developed for checking and refining planning knowledge tend to
focus on automated plan generation rather than helping users author process
information.  In this paper, we propose a complementary approach which helps
users author and check process models.  Our system, called <A HREF="KANAL-description.txt">KANAL</A> (Knowledge
ANALysis), relates pieces of information in process models among themselves
and to the existing KB, analyzing how different pieces of input are put
together to achieve some effect.  It builds interdependency models from this
analysis and uses them to find errors and propose fixes.

<p>
KANAL builds upon previous work on <A
HREF="http://www.isi.edu/expect/">EXPECT</A> using Interdependency Models (<A
HREF="http://www.isi.edu/expect/link/publications.html#Kim-Gil-AAAI-99">Kim and Gil
AAAI-99</A>, <A
HREF="http://www.isi.edu/expect/link/publications.html#Kim-Gil-AAAI-2000">Kim and Gil
AAAI-2000</A>).  The work on EXPECT analyzed problem-solving interdependencies,
which model how different pieces of problem solving (procedural) knowledge
relate to each other and to the class definitions in domain ontologies.  Our
initial work concentrates on <i>process models</i>, i.e., knowledge
describing activities and subprocesses as well as their relationships.

<p>
Currently, KANAL's checks are done on the simulated execution of the process
model.  Using skolem instances, we can check general scenarios of the
animation of a process. The result of each animation are used as a model of
interdependencies among the sub-steps of the process model.  KANAL performs a
variety of verification checks to process models, including <i>unachieved
conditions of steps</i> in a process model, <i>expected and unexpected
effects, potential loops</i>, and <i>disjunctive model branches</i>.  KANAL
will also help users with validation checks of <i> redundancies</i>, and
<i>resource use</i> within a process model.

The role of Knowledge Analysis within the architecture of the
RKF SRI team is to guard the Knowledge Server (KS) against possibly
invalid statements entered by the user and to point out to the
Interaction Manager (IM) what additional knowledge needs to be acquired.
Its main functions are: 
<p> - relating different knowledge inputs among themselves and to the existing KB
<p> - detecting inconsistencies and knowledge gaps
