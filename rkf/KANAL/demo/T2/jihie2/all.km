#| based on comments from General Otstott
Engagement type --------------------------------------------

Attack-by-fire  - 2  ***Should be 1, I believe.  A battalion could attack another battalion by fire, because he does not have to "close with, and destroy" the enemy battalion.***
Block - 1/3
Bypass - 1
Canalize - 1/3
Clear - 3
Defeat - 3
Destroy - 3
Disrupt - 1
Fix - 2 ***Should be 1, for much the same reason as above.***
Guard - 1
Interdict - 1
Neutralize - 1
Occupy - 2 ***Occupy is normally done on vacant terrain, so this is a meaningless force ration.  I think 1 would be a better default for that reason.***
Retain - 1/3
Secure - 1
Seize - 3
Screen - 1
Support-by-Fire - 1
Suppress - 2 ***Should be 1 since this is similar to "attack by fire" and "support by fire" just above.


Non Engagement type --------------------------------------------
Move 
Reserve 
Follow-and-Assume (Is this a non-engagement type?)
Follow-and-Support 

***I think I would be inclined to use default value 1 for each of these.  In the "follow and assume" and "follow and support" tasks, the relative combat power or force ratio is additive to the unit that is being followed.  In the reserve and move tasks, 1 is as good a number as any until the unit gets employed or used in an engagement.  Then the circumstances of relative positional advantage, use of terrain, offense vs defense, etc serve to modify the force ratio.***
