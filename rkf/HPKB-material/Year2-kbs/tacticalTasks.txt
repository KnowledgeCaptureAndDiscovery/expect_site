comment : "To attack by fire is to engage the enemy with
          direct and indirect fire: to fix, destroy, suppress,
          or deceive him. The friendly force does not close
          with the enemy or occupy the objective. An attack by
          fire is usually a supporting effort during offensive
          operations and a counterattack by fire option for the
          reserve during defensive operations. It is not done
          in conjunction with another maneuvering force. The
          force conducting an attack by fire may be assigned a
          battle position with either a sector of fire or an
          engagement area, or it may be assigned an axis of
          advance and a force-oriented objective. The enemy may
          be stationary or moving. An attack by fire closely
          resembles the task of support by fire. The chief
          difference is that support by fire is conducted to
          support another force so that force can maneuver
          against the enemy." .

;BREACH

;A Breach is both a tactical task and an enabling operation in which any
;means available are employed to break through or secure a passage
;through an enemy defense, obstacle, minefield, or fortification. 
;To maintain his tempo and momentum, a commander attempts to bypass
;and avoid obstacles to the maximum extent possible. Breaching enemy
;obstacle systems is normally his last choice. When they occur, they
;are a synchronized combined arms operation under the control of the
;maneuver commander. There are three types of breaching operations:
;hasty, deliberate, or assault. The type of breach conducted depends
;on the nature of the obstacle and the capabilities of the enemy 
;force covering the obstacle.

;A unit may breach an enemy's obstacle system using covert means before
;beginning a ground attack. Primarily used by dismounted forces,
;covert breaching centers around using stealth to reduce the obstacle,
;with support and assault forces executing their mission only if the
;breach force is detected. Achieving surprise is the primary reason
;for employing a covert breach.

comment : "To bypass is to maneuver around an obstacle,
          position, or enemy force to maintain the momentum of
          the operation. A bypass can take place in both
          offensive or defensive operations. When conducting a
          bypass, the commander deliberately avoids combat with
          an enemy force so that all of his combat power is
          directed toward mission accomplishment." .
cyclistNotes : "The force conducting the bypass conducts
               several subordinate tasks. These include
               reporting any bypassed obstacles and enemy
               forces to higher headquarters immediately. They
               also include keeping the bypassed enemy under
               observation until relieved by another force." .

;comment: "To bypass is to maneuver around an obstacle, position, or enemy
;force to maintain the momentum of the operation. A bypass can take
;place in both offensive or defensive operations. When conducting
;a bypass, the commander deliberately avoids combat with an enemy
;force so that all of his combat power is directed toward mission
;accomplishment.

;The decision to bypass is based on 
; * Analysis of the mission. 
; * The requirement to maintain momentum and aggressive action. 
; * The commander's knowledge of enemy strength, intent or mission. 
; * The degree to which the bypassed enemy can interfere with the advance. 
; * The general state of the enemy force; for example, if enemy resistance
;   is crumbling, the 4 friendly force can take greater risks. 
; * Any bypass criteria established by a higher headquarters. 

;The force conducting the bypass conducts several subordinate
;tasks. These include reporting any bypassed obstacles and enemy
;forces to higher headquarters immediately. They also include keeping
;the bypassed enemy under observation until relieved by another
;force. 

;Authority to bypass is not normally delegated below battalion task
;force level. A bypass criteria is established that limits the size
;of the enemy force that can be bypassed without the authority of the
;next higher commander. Generally a force does not attempt bypass if
;it requires more than 40 percent of that force's combat power to
;fix the enemy in current positions. Before starting the bypass, the
;commander ensures that the bypass route is checked for enemy
;presence and trafficability. At no time can the enemy force be allowed
;to interfere with the bypassing unit. 

;The two bypass techniques that the force can employ are avoid the
;enemy, and fix the enemy by fire and bypass. If the force cannot avoid
;the enemy, the bypassing force must fix the enemy with part of its
;maneuver elements and bypass with the balance of the force.  The
;commander normally directs a subordinate element to fix and maintain
;contact with the enemy until it is relieved. This may require the
;reinforcement of the fixing force. If the commander assigns more than
;one subordinate element the appoints an overall commander of the
;fixing force. The fixing force commander coordinates with the unit
;assigned to relieve him as soon as possible and provides that
;commander with all available information about the enemy and
;terrain. The relieving unit is normally another unit assigned a follow
;and support task. Once relieved, the force fixing the enemy either
;rejoins its parent organization or becomes part of the following
;element and comes under its control.

;Occasionally the fixing force may be directed to break contact with
;the enemy after the bypassing force has completed the bypass. This
;occurs when the bypassing force has no requirement to maintain an
;uninterrupted logistics flow, such as in a raid. In this case, the
;fixing force blocks the enemy through employing defensive, delaying,
;and limited offensive actions in synchronization with all available
;fire support until ordered to rejoin the bypassing force.".

hostile observation of a force, area, or place. Counterreconnaissance is 
an element of all security operations and most local
security measures. It involves both active and passive elements and
includes combat action to destroy or repel enemy reconnaissance
units.

Stripping away enemy ground reconnaissance while denying the enemy
information through other collection systems allows friendly force
commanders to operate against an enemy who is operating blindly. The
enemy commander's inability to see the battlefield will eventually
desynchronize his actions and render his command vulnerable to
aggressive action by friendly forces.".

;       (b) Fires to suppress the enemy and cover the unit's movement.

;        Chapter 18.) 
;       * The time disengagement starts. 
;       *  The earliest time that CS and CSS elements are to move. 

;The senior headquarters conducts operations to support the disengaging
;forces and relieve pressure on units in contact with the enemy. For
;example, if a division is conducting a delay, the division commander
;can use his aviation assets to help a ground maneuver brigade
;disengage from the close fight. Simultaneously, the division uses its
;long-range artillery, rocket, and EW systems to destroy or disrupt
;enemy follow on echelons to prevent them from interfering with the
;disengagement. The intent is to create conditions that allow the unit
;to disengage while avoiding decisive combat.

genls: MilitaryDefensiveTask.
comment: "To disrupt is to integrate direct and indirect 
fires, terrain, and obstacles to upset an enemy's formation or
tempo, interrupt his timetable, or cause his forces to commit
prematurely or attack in a piecemeal fashion. This increases the
enemy's vulnerability to friendly fires. It may temporarily knock
a unit out of the battle. Disruption is never an ends in itself,
it is the means to an end. 

The maneuver force attempting to disrupt an enemy must attack the
enemy force with enough combat power to achieve the desired results
with one mass attack or sustain the attack until it achieves the
desired results.  It may involve the attacking of the enemy in
depth. The commander determines the amount of risk he is willing to
accept based on the friendly losses he is willing to accept, the
location of the attack, and the number of attacks that will be
made. 

Disrupt is also one of the four primary functions (disrupt, fix, turn,
and block) of tactical obstacles that integrates fire planning and
obstacle effect to slow an attacker within a specified area, normally
an engagement area. See FM 5-100, Engineer Combat Operations, for
more information on tactical obstacles.".

genls: WithdrawalFromCombat MilitaryTask.
comment: "To exfiltrate is to remove personnel or units from areas under enemy
control by stealth, deception, surprise, or clandestine
means. Exfiltration is conducted by friendly forces that have been
encircled by enemy forces and cannot conduct a breakout or be relieved
by other friendly forces. Forces returning from a raid, an
infiltration, or a patrol behind enemy lines can also conduct an
exfiltration. Exfiltration by an encircled force is used only as a
last resort to preserve a portion of the force. It is preferable to
the capture of the force. The exfiltrating force conducts it after
destroying or incapacitating all equipment (less medical) not
accompanying the force. The exfiltrating force may have to leave
casualties in place with supplies, chaplain support, and medical
attendants.

Exfiltration is most feasible over rough or difficult terrain through
areas lightly covered by enemy observation and fire. These conditions
often allow undetected movement of small elements when movement of the
entire force would present more risk. Exfiltration requires
resourcefulness, a high degree of discipline, expert land navigational
skills, and motivation. It is unlikely that the entire force will be
able to exfiltrate since part of it may have to create a
diversion. Good small-unit leadership is essential in this type of
operation.

Before starting the exfiltration, the exfiltrating force establishes
its rally points and exfiltration lanes. It coordinates its linkup
plans with other friendly units. The exfiltration lanes are designated
restricted fire areas (RFAs) or no fire areas (NFAs). The exfiltrating
force uses preparatory fires to cover its movement as well as a means
of expending stockpiled ammunition. Based on reconnaissance and
available intelligence, the exfiltrating force subdivides into small
groups and exfiltrates during periods of limited visibility by passing
through and around enemy defensive positions. If detected, it tries to
bypass the enemy. Exfiltration may be more difficult with combat and
tactical vehicles because of the noise that they make and the
limitations they impose on exfiltration routes, which makes their
detection by the enemy more likely.".

    * Guard prisoners, key areas, and installations.

Follow and support is used to avoid the force being supported from
having to commit its combat power among tasks other than those of the
main mission, which would slow the momentum of the offensive. The
follow and support force must accomplish its tasks to prevent the
enemy, obstacles, and other factors from interfering with offensive
operations, especially along the lines of communications.

The commander assigning the follow and support task has two options in
establishing the relationship between the supported and the
supporting units. He can place the follow and support unit in a
standard command relationship with the supported unit, such as
attached or operational control. Alternatively, he can require that 
all tasking from the supported unit go through his headquarters for

comment: "To interdict is to prevent, hinder, or delay the
          enemy's use of an area or route. Interdiction is
          conducted to complement and reinforce other ongoing
          offensive or defensive operations. An interdiction
          tasking must specify the enemy force to be interdicted.
          It must also specify the area or route to be
          interdicted, how long the interdiction is to be in
          effect, defined either as a length of time or some
          event that must occur before the interdiction is lifted
          or the exact effect desired from the interdiction.".



;Aerial and ground maneuver should be designed to present an
;interdicted enemy with a dilemma. Actual or threatened ground maneuver
;can force an enemy to respond by attempting rapid movement or
;resupply, which provides targets to the unit interdicting that
;location. This creates a dilemma for the enemy. If he attempts to
;counter the ground maneuver, his forces will be exposed to
;unacceptable losses from aerial maneuver. If he employs measures to
;reduce such losses, his forces will not be able to counter the ground
;maneuver. Taking full advantage of the enemy's dilemma depends on the
;ability of friendly ground forces to exploit his delays and
;disruption.

;The depth at which the attacking force conduct the interdiction
;generally determines the friendly force's freedom of
;action. Increasing the depth of operations reduces the danger of
;fratricide to friendly air and surface forces, reduces the
;coordination required, and allows increasingly flexible
;operations. With more freedom of action, aerial forces leave the
;enemy with no location that is immune from attack. 

;The depth at which the task is conducted often determines the speed
;with which its effects are seen. Normally, ground maneuver units
;first focus on targets close to the forward line own troops
;(FLOT). Interdiction efforts there will have immediate impact on
;those enemy forces in the vicinity of the attacks but do not effect
;the enemy's ability to mass force effects. Attacks at greater
;distances from the FLOT will have a delayed impact on the direct
;fire fight but do eventually effect the enemy's ability to mass direct
;fire effects.

;The friendly force's capability to interdict may have a devastating
;impact on the enemy's plans and ability to respond to friendly
;actions. For example, delaying or disrupting enemy maneuver enhances
;the friendly force's ability to achieve tactical advantages. Delaying
;or disrupting enemy resupply efforts limits the enemy's ability to
;sustain intense, high-tempo offensive or defensive operations and
;restricts the mobility of his forces.

;Interdicting the movement of enemy units can be extremely effective in
;assisting their encirclement and eventual destruction. Fixed enemy
;ground forces or those trapped by the loss of their mobility provide
;lucrative targets. The commander should plan to interdict withdrawing
;enemy forces to enhance his pursuit. While interdiction can contribute
;to success by hampering reinforcement and resupply, it can also
;contribute by trapping enemy forces or channeling their maneuvers,
;thus leading to their destruction in detail." .

comment : "There are three basic types of river crossings: hasty,

          conducted as part of a larger operation, typically an attack,
          with no intentional pause at the water line. When a hasty
          river crossing is not feasible such as when the enemy or
          terrain situations prevent it, a hasty crossing attempt
          fails, or friendly offensive operations resume at a river
          line after a pause, the force conducts a deliberate river
          crossing operation. A retrograde river crossing is a movement

comment:"To secure is to gain possession of a position or terrain feature with
or without force and try to prevent its destruction or loss by enemy
action. A unit does not have to physically occupy a geographical
location to secure it if the unit can prevent the enemy from occupying
or firing at that location by other means. The subordinate tasks
associated with secure are to prevent enemy direct and observed
indirect fire from impacting on the secured area and to prevent any
enemy forces from occupying or using the secured area.

The unit securing the area must normally conduct area security
activities. (See Chapter 16.) The tasks of secure differs from that of
control because control allows enemy direct and indirect fires to
affect the area being controlled. When assigning a mission to secure,
the commander must state the area to be secured and the duration of
the mission, which is a time- or event-driven constraint.".

tasks.  

This task differs from that of secure because it requires offensive
action to obtain control of the designated area or objective. Once the
force gains control, it clears the terrain within that designated area
or objective by killing, capturing, or forcing the withdrawal of all
enemy forces.".

comment: "A passage of lines is generally a task in which one unit

          moves through another unit's position with the intent of moving into

          or out of enemy contact. It involves the transfer of responsibility

          for fighting an enemy force from one unit to another in close

          operations. The commander's reason for conducting a passage of lines

          is to sustain the tempo of an offensive operation with fresh forces

          to a defense task. FM100-40, p. 18-2.".

comment : "A relief in place is an enabling operation in which ...
          all or part of a unit is replaced in an area by an incoming
          unit. ... Normally, the unit relieved is defending. However,
          a relief may set the stage for a resumption of offensive
          operations. A relief may also serve to free the relieved unit
          for other tasks, such as decontamination, reconstitution,
          routine rest, resupply, maintenance, or specialized training.
          Sometimes, as part of a larger operation, a commander wants
          the enemy to discover the relief because it will cause the
          enemy to do something in response that is prejudicial to his
          interest, such as move reserves from an area where the
          friendly commander wants to conduct a penetration. FM100-40,
