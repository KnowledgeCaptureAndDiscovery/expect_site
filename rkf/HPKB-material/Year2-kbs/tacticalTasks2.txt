constant : MobileDefense-MilitaryOperation .

in Mt: ModernMilitaryTacticsMt .

isa: ScriptType TemporalObjectType IKBConstant.

genls: MilitaryDefensiveOperation.

comment : "The mobile defense operation focuses on defeating or

destroying the enemy force by allowing him to advance to a point where

he is exposed to a decisive counterattack by the striking force. The

commander organizes his force into two principal groups: the fixing

force and the striking force. The primary defeat mechanism, the

counterattack, is supplemented by the fires of the fixing force. The

mobile defense is normally conducted by brigades, divisions and corps.

Battalions and smaller units do not conduct a mobile defense because

they are incapable of conducting operations in depth and fighting

multiple engagements while resourcing the striking force, the fixing

force, and a reserve.  FM100- 40, Ch12." .

 

constant : Envelopment-MilitaryOperation.

in Mt: ModernMilitaryTacticsMt.

isa: ScriptType TemporalObjectType IKBConstant.

genls : MilitaryOffensiveOperation.

comment : "In an envelopment, the main attack focuses on seizing an

objective in the enemy rear that cuts his escape routes and subjects

him to destruction in his current positions. In an envelopment

operation, the commander seeks to strike an assailable flank. It

avoids the enemy's strength - his front - where the effects of his

fires and obstacles are the greatest. FM100-40, p3-18. ".

 





constant : FrontalAttack-MilitaryOperation .

in Mt: ModernMilitaryTacticsMt .

isa : ScriptType TemporalObjectType IKBConstant.

genls : MilitaryOffensiveOperation.

comment : "The frontal attack is a military operation employed either

to overrun or destroy a weaker enemy force or as a supporting or

secondary force in conjunction with other choices of maneuver. ... It

is also used by a friendly force that has overwhelming combat power to

maintain momentum. ... Whereas the penetration is designed as a sharp

attack to rupture the enemy position, the frontal attack is designed

to maintain continuous pressure along the entire front until either a

breach occurs or forces succeed in pushing the enemy back. FM100-40,

p3-16." .

 

constant : SingleEnvelopment-MilitaryOperation .

constant : Encirclement-MilitaryOperation .

in Mt: ModernMilitaryTacticsMt.

isa : ScriptType TemporalObjectType IKBConstant.

genls : Envelopment-MilitaryOperation .

comment : "Encirclements are intended to enclose and capture or defeat large

enemy forces. Typically, encirclements either result from penetrations and

envelopments or are an extension of exploitation and pursuit

operations. .. They may be planned sequels or result from the exploitation of

an unforeseen opportunity. They usually result from the linkup of two forces

conducting a double envelopment. However, they can occur in situations where a

major obstacle such as a shoreline can be used as the second encircling wing

by the attacking commander. Although terrain objectives may be designated in

an encirclement, isolation and defeat of enemy forces are the primary

goals. FM100-40, p9-7." .



constant : TurningMovement-MilitaryOperation .

in Mt: ModernMilitaryTacticsMt .

isa : ScriptType TemporalObjectType IKBConstant.

genls : MilitaryAttack .

comment : "In a turning movement, an attacking force seeks to pass

around and avoid the enemy's main force, then secure an objective deep

in the hostile rear area that causes the enemy to move out of its

current positions or divert major forces to meet the threat. A

commander uses this choice of maneuver when the opportunity exists to

seize vital areas in the hostile rear before the main enemy force can

withdraw or receive support or reinforcements. A supporting effort may

be required to fix the enemy, such as an envelopment. However, a

turning movement is not always accompanied by a supporting effort. A

turning movement differs from an envelopment because the force

conducting a turning movement is normally out of supporting range of

the main body but is within supporting distance. This choice of

maneuver frequently transitions from the attack into an exploitation

or pursuit. Although the turning force is frequently the main force,

it may not always be. FM100-40." .

action forces the enemy to react rather than act (FM100-5, p2-4). This

classification is for those tasks which are viewed as positive means

to seize or maintain the initiative. We consider that maintaining the

initiative requires control of the enemy and control of the

battlefield (maintain mobility / freedom of maneuver; seizure and

control of key / decisive terrain). Accordingly, included here are all

those tasks which could be assigned and whose ultimate

objective/purpose could be to maintain enemy contact, to

preserve/maintain battlefield mobility, to defeat or destroy the

;       Translation-LocationChange CooperationEvent .

;Comment : "A passage of lines is an generally an operation in which

;one unit moves through another unit's positions with the intent of

;moving into or out of enemy contact. It involves the transfer of

;responsibility for fighting an enemy force from one unit to another in

;close operations.  The commander's reasons for conducting a passage of

;lines are to sustain the tempo of an offensive operation with fresh

;forces; to maintain viability of the defense by introducing fresh

;forces; to transition from a delay or security operation by one force

;to a defense; and to free a unit for another mission or

;task. FM100-40, p18-2. (However, note that a passage of lines could be

;done with or without the enemy being involved. Passage of lines is

;primarily the task of moving one unit through another unit without

;shooting one another. This is sometimes refined by saying passage of

;lines "with contact" - meaning the enemy is shooting at you while you

;do the passage. A passage of lines is usually associated with

;additional tasks such as "withdraw and conduct passage of lines

;through the 1st Brigade," or "conduct a forward passage of lines and

;attack to seize objective slam.  Our source has not seen forward

;passage of lines used to indicate an attack all on its own.)" .
