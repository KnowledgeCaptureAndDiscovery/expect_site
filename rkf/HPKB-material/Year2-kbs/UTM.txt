comment: "The collection of cartesian coordinate systems based upon a set

of perpendicular coordinate planes.  Each CartesianCoordinateSystem has its

own measure predicates.  In a CartesianCoordinateSystem, SYS, for a two- or

three-dimensional space, the x distance coordinates, DISTANCE-X, (distance

from the y axis, or from the yz plane) of a SpatialThing, THING,  are

expressed using a xAxisPredOfSystem PRED-X, specified by

(xAxisPredOfSystem PRED-X SYS), in assertions of the form (PRED-X THING

DISTANCE-X).  In the same CartesianCoordinateSystem, SYS, the y distance

coordinates, DISTANCE-Y, (distance from the x axis, or from the xz plane)

of a SpatialThing, THING,  are expressed using a yAxisPredOfSystem PRED-Y,

specified by (yAxisPredOfSystem PRED-Y SYS), in assertions of the form

(PRED-Y THING DISTANCE-Y).  Similary, the z distance coordinates,

DISTANCE-Z, (distance from the xy plane) of a SpatialThing, THING,  are

expressed using a zDistancePredicate PRED-Z, specified by

(zDistancePredicate PRED-Z SYS), in assertions of the form (PRED-Z THING

DISTANCE-Z).".

comment: "A coordinateSystem based upon the CartesianCoordinateSystem, that

sections the earth into many zones, each zone being a 6 degree latitudinal

slice of the earth's surface.  X directions are measured relative to the

central meridian of the zone, while y directions are measured relative to

the equator.  Each THING within a UTMCoordinate system needs an easting,

northing, and utmZone.".

comment: "#$easting is the #$xAxisPredOfSystem of the UTMCoordinateSystem,

i.e. within the UTMCoordinateSystem, easting is the predicate used to

measure the distance from the y-axis.  eastings are measured relative to a

particular utmZone and the central meridian of that zone, and approximately

represent distance in meters from the western boundry of the a UTM zone.

By offsetting the easting of the central meridian to 500,000, all easting

values are guaranteed to be postitive: a zone is at most 1,000,000 meters

wide.  (#$easting THING DIST) means that SpatialThing THING is located at

[DIST - 500,000] east of the central meridian, for DIST greater than 500,000, or

[500,000 - DIST] west of the central meridian, for DIST less than 500,000.  All

eastings are relative to a particular utmZone.".

comment: "(utmZone THING ZONE) represents the UTM Zone that THING can be

found in.  A utmZone is 6 degrees latitude wide, and mapped directly to the

surface of the earth.  Hence, any stationary object has a unique utmZone,

the utmZone in which the longitude line of the object falls.".
