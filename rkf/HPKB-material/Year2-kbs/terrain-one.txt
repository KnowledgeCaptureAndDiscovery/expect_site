UNITTYPE is capable of playing ROLE in every

generally suitable for units of said type to play said role in events

of this kind.  For talking about *levels* of restriction with respect

to trafficability for unit- and maneuver-type, see

#$trafficabilityLevelForUnitType.".

cyclistNotes: "This is probably the most specific and versatile of the

terrain trafficability predicates. An avenue of approach that will be

trafficable for one kind of unit performing one kind of task or

maneuver will not necessarily be trafficable for another kind of unit

performing a different kind of task or maneuver: this predicate allows

us to take account of that possibility should it prove necessary.  The

predicate #$degreeOfTrafficability refers to a kind of generic

trafficability level for all kinds military units and does not allow

us to make this distinction; the predicate #$trafficableForUnit is

instance level and not type.  These other predicates do have their

uses, however, and so for the moment we will keep the whole

ensemble.".

comment: "A collection of attributes: instances are attributes that

describe the general trafficability of a particular instance of

#$AvenueOfApproach or #$MobilityCorridor without being particularly

specific as to the nature and character of the terrain, or the nature

and character of the agents for whom the terrain is trafficable.  Such

attributes will often be referenced with the instances of

#$GenericValueFunction.  In addition, there are three instances

explicitly reified: #$TerrainUnrestricted, #$TerrainRestricted, and

#$TerrainSeverelyRestricted.".

cyclistNotes: "The instances of this class of attributes are to be

used primarily in circumstances where it is possible to talk about the

'level' of trafficability of a particular region independent of the

characteristics and capabilities of the agents that are traveling in

that region.  Five of the six levels of #$TerrainTrafficabilityLevel that

can be reified via the five instances of #$GenericValueFunction correspond

to the

Avenue of Approach and Mobility Corridor attributes reference on p. 68

of v.1.0 of the COA CP specification.  If the user is dealing with a

situation where the terrain trafficability varies with the kind and

situation of the agent, he or she is strongly urged to use

#$trafficableForUnitTypeInRole instead.".
