;The Scheme Behind This File This file assumes that battlespace source



;will be represented as instances of #$PropositionalInformationThing

;(PITs).  PITs are a specialized form of microtheory, and the working

;assumption is that propositions deriving from the source will

;henceforth be asserted in the PIT-Mt of the source itself, as reified

;in Cyc, with the genlMt access links being established accordingly via

;forward-firing rules.



;It was always planned that specialized battlespace source mts would be

;specializations of the ModernMilitaryTacticsMt: this is really the

;only available option since having the access links the other way

;round involves an untenable explosion of genlMt links to the

;ModernMilitaryVehiclesMt, the MilitaryForceStructureMt, and the like.

;As it stands, the implied microtheory structure is this with access running

;bottom-to-top:





;  ModMilWeaponsMt  MilitaryForceStructureMt ModMilVehiclesMt

;       \                     |                 /

;        \                    |                /

;          \                  |              /

;           ---------ModernMilitarTacticsMt--

;                        /     |     \

;                       /      |      \

;                 PITMt1   PITMt2      PITMt3

;                    \        |          /

;                     \       |         /

;                     BattlespaceMilitaryMt

;                         |

;                         |

;                   COASpecMts &c.



;If closer cooperation between Battlespace and CM work is desired, the

;ModernMilitaryMt can be replaced with the BattlespaceMilitaryMt:

;however, there are certain assumptions about MilitaryOperations and

;MilitaryTasks that the CM community does not wish to inherit at this

;time.



;In certain cases, we will want data from a particular source to be

;asserted in the higher-level ModernMilitaryTacticsMt: source alone is

;not definitional of generality.  In these cases, use of the predicate

;#$sourceOfTerm-PIT can be used to project a duplicate of the assertion

;downward into the appropriate source mt for bookkeeping purposes, due

;to a forward-firing rule attaching to this predicate.
