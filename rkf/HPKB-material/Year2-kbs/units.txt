SUPERUNIT, or its commanding officer, are authorized to issue orders to

SUBUNIT. SUBUNIT need not be an immediate subordinate of SUPERUNIT, -- it

could also be several steps down in the chain of command. Even if SUBUNIT is

not getting any financial or logistic support from SUPERUNIT, it is still in a

          it is not likely to persist beyond the end of it. For example,

          in the military a particular battalion might be attached to a

          particular brigade to provide logistical support during a

          military campaign: this relationship would be a

comment : "(sovereignAllegianceOfUnit MIL-UNIT COUNTRY) means

          This predicate relates a military organization to whatever sovereign

          agency that ultimately responsible for its creation. The agency is

          usually an instance of IndependentCountry. For example, the 101st

          Airborne Division has as its sovereignAllegianceOfUnit the

          UnitedStatesOfAmerica. However, the first argument need not be

          an instance of IndependentCountry: military and paramilitary

          forces can be organized by corporations (e.g., the

          Freeport-MacMoRan security force in Indonesia) or even by

          individuals (e.g., the Duvaliers' Tonton Macoutes).

          sovereignAllegianceOfUnit is also a different concept from

          'assignment' and/or 'attachment' in a command-and-control

          structure. An American battalion might be placed under temporary

          UN command in an international action. However, the

          This predicate corresponds to the concept known in military

          subordination-relation with any number of intermediate levels

          however, in modern times the term has come to refer almost

          exclusively to certain kinds of motorized armored unit.



         The basic missions of cavalry units are reconnaissance, security, and economy

         of force. The ability of cavalry units to find the enemy, to develop the situation,

         and to provide the commander with reaction time and security also make

         them ideal for operating in an economy-of-force role. Cavalry forces

         can delay an attacking enemy as well as assist in a withdrawal. Air cavalry units

         perform the same missions of reconnaissance and security as ground

         cavalry and are organic to all cavalry units. Because of their greater mobility,

         air cavalry troops can reconnoiter and maintain surveillance over a much larger

         area in a shorter period of time than ground troops. During security

         operations, the air cavalry reconnoiters, screens forward and to the flanks of

         ground forces, and acts as a rapid reaction force.".

          infantry train and fight as a team to defeat enemy armored forces. When

comment : "Light infantry units can operate effectively in most terrain

      and weather. They may be the dominant arm in fast-breaking

      operations because of their rapid strategic deployability. In such cases,

      they can wrest the initiative early, seize and hold ground, and mass fires

      to stop the enemy in restrictive terrain. They are particularly effective

      in urban terrain. They can infiltrate and move rapidly to the enemy rear.

      Their tactical mobility is enhanced through the use of helicopter support

      and tactical airlift.



      Light infantry units are capable of rapid deployment due to their austere

      but lethal design. They may operate throughout the battlefield and can be

      rapidly augmented for almost any task or situation. Light infantry units

      are especially useful for operations in difficult terrain and urbanized areas.

      They operate primarily at night or during periods of limited visibility in

      close or restrictive terrain. Light infantry units achieve decisive results

      through the employment of organic and supporting forces and weapons

      systems. ".

   and to facilitate the movement of counterattack forces. In all types of

          A principal means of fire support in fire and maneuver is the field

          artillery. It not only provides fires with cannon, rocket, and missile

          systems but also integrates all means of fire support available to the

          enemy direct fire forces, attack enemy artillery and mortars, and

          deliver scatterable mines to isolate and interdict enemy forces or

          protect friendly operations. Field artillery units contribute to attacking

          the enemy throughout the depth of his formations and suppress enemy

          air defense systems to facilitate ground and air operations. As
