<h1>The SHAKEN action description language (SADL)</h1>
<p>Jim Blythe, Feb 14th 2001
<br>
With contributions from Pete, John, Paul, Gary, Pat, Bruce, Ken,
Yolanda, Jihie and others.
</p>

<p>
The SHAKEN system needs to be able to reason about processes that
contain loops, conditional steps, partially ordered steps and
disjunctive steps to meet our goals for May. The language described here
makes minimal necessary extensions to the process description language
already existing in KM that will allow this.  Because the extensions are
small, implementing them in each of the components of SHAKEN should be
straightforward, and further extensions can be made in the future as
needed. Because a process description will be shared between several
components, we need a very clear understanding of the meaning of each
construct in the language and also of how each component can use the
language. 
</p>

<p>
This document summarizes the existing language, describes the extensions
and then shows how they are represented in KM. After this we mention
some constructs that may be added later, and link to an example based on
the December model of RNA transcription.
</p>

<p>
A short comparison between SADL and the action languages PDDL, DAML+S
and TAPIR can be found <a href="sadl-mapping.html">here</a>.
</p>

<H2>Events, steps and event instances</H2>

<p>
Feel free to skip this section unless you are interested in how the
representation of sub-steps in processes has been influenced by KM's
policy of creating skolem instances.
</p>

<p>
An <em>event</em> like ``Move'' is represented in KM independently of
any particular process description. When a process description refers to
a Move, it refers to a <em>step</em> in the process that implements the
Move event. A process description may have several, distinct Move
steps. Likewise a step in a process description has a
<strong>next-step</strong>, but the event description does not. Finally
when a process is executed, the actual execution of the step is an
<em>event instance</em>.
</p>

<p>
This is a change from the original representation, where the sub-steps
of a process were described directly as event classes. The reason for
this change is that, if some of the sub-steps of a process form a loop,
a different event instance should be created each time a sub-step is
executed within the loop. In the original scheme, skolem event instances
for sub-steps are created when the parent event is created, but for a
sub-step in a loop it is not clear which execution the skolem event
instance refers to. In the new scheme, skolem step instances are created
when the parent event is created, and child event instances are only
created when the sub-step is executed.
</p>

<p>
In the rest of this document I only refer to steps.
</p>

<H2>The existing action language</H2>

The current language for describing processes in KM makes use of steps
that can have several sub-steps. When a step in a process is to be
executed, all of its sub-steps should be executed. A step in a process
may also include a <strong>next-step</strong> slot that determines the
next step to be executed. Here is an example:
</P>

<PRE>
(every RNA-Transcription-Process has
   (sub-steps
     (a Step called "collide" with
       (event-type-to-do (Collide))
       (next-step (((the sub-steps of Self) called "recognize"))))
     (a Step called "recognize" with
       (event-type-to-do (Recognize))
       (next-step (((the sub-steps of Self) called "copy"))))
     (a Step called "copy" with
       (event-type-to-do (Copy))
       (next-step (((the sub-steps of Self) called "release"))))
     (a Step called "release")))
</PRE>

<P>
The meaning of the <strong>sub-steps</strong> and
<strong>next-step</strong> values on this example is that to execute an
RNA-Transcription-Process, the steps called ``collide'', ``recognize'',
``copy'' and ``release'' are executed in that order.
</P>

<P>
No sub-step is explicitly designated the first step in this process.
Any step that is not the next-step for some other step could potentially
take place first.
</P>

<H2>Loops, disjunctive, conditional and partially ordered steps</H2>

<P>
Steps in a process are <em>partially ordered</em> if the order in which
the steps take place is incompletely specified. A partial ordering
over steps does not mean that the steps can be executed
simultaneously, only that the full, linear ordering of the steps is
not specified. For instance if two trucks need to go through a narrow
tunnel, they cannot both go through at the same time although we may
not care which goes first.
</P>

<P>
A process description has a <em>loop</em> if a sequence of steps can
be repeated. For example in the description ``the polymerase moves
forward <bf>until</bf> the promoter region is reached'', the
<em>move</em> step is a single-step loop. Loops usually have a
termination condition which is tested each time the loop is completed.
</P>

<P>
A <em>conditional step</em> is one that is executed only if some condition
is met, for example ``if the gas tank is empty, fill it''. The condition
is usually tested against the world state immediately before choosing to
execute the step.
</P>

<P>
Two or more steps are <em>disjunctive</em> if only one of them will take
place. For instance: ``to get to the zoo, <em>either</em> take the 10
freeway <em>or</em> take the 5 freeway''.
</P>

<P>
For ease of implementation, this language defines both loops and
disjunctive steps in terms of conditional steps, as I describe below.
</P>

<H2>Extending the existing KM representation</H2>

<H3>Partially ordered steps</H3>

<P>
A concise way to represent partial orders is to allow more than one step
in the <strong>next-step</strong> field, with the intended meaning that
each step is executed eventually, but their order is undefined. However,
steps do not take place simultaneously.  If two or more steps designate
the same step <em>e</em> as <strong>next-step</strong>, and the
designating steps have a common ancestor, then <em>e</em> is considered
a <em>join</em> step, meaning that it cannot be executed until all the
designating steps have been executed.
</P>

<P>
For example, suppose a process to move two trucks through a gate
requires first opening the gate, then moving both trucks (in any order),
then closing the gate. This can be represented as follows:

<PRE>
(every move-trucks-process has
  (sub-steps
    (a Step with
      (event-type-to-do (open-gate))
      (next-step (((the sub-steps of Self) called "move1")
                  ((the sub-steps of Self) called "move2"))))
    (a Step called "move1" with
      (event-type-to-do (move))
      (next-step (((the sub-steps of Self) called "close-gate"))))
    (a Step called "move2" with
      (event-type-to-do (move))
      (next-step (((the sub-steps of Self) called "close-gate"))))
    (a Step called "close-gate" with
      (event-type-to-do (close-gate)))))
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
Since <strong>open-gate</strong> is the only step in the process that is
not the value of <strong>next-step</strong> for some other step, it is
the first step to be executed. After <strong>open-gate</strong>, either
<strong>move1</strong> or <strong>move2</strong> are executable. Suppose
<strong>move1</strong> is executed. Although the
<strong>next-step</strong> field is <strong>close-gate</strong>, this
step cannot be executed because <strong>move2</strong>, which also has
<strong>close-gate</strong> as its <strong>next-step</strong> field, has
not yet been executed. So after executing <strong>move1</strong>, the
order of the remaining steps is uniquely determined.
</P>

<P>
If there is more than one step in a process that is not designated as
the <strong>next-step</strong> of some other step, they should be interpreted
as a set of potential first steps that are unordered with respect to
each other.
</P>

<H3>Conditional steps</H3>

<P>
The following syntax can be used to represent conditional steps:
</P>

<PRE>
(a Step called "move" with
  (event-type-to-do (Move))
  (test ('((the location of Self) = (the promotor region...))))
  (next-step ((:args t   ((the sub-steps of Self) called "recognize"))
              (:args NIL ((the sub-steps of Self) called "move")))))
</PRE>

<P>
Either branch can be empty, indicating that there is no next step in
that case.
</P>

<h3>Loops</H3>

<P>
The above example implements a loop where the <strong>move</strong> step is
repeated until the test in the <strong>next-step</strong> condition is met.
The condition plays the role of the termination condition for the
loop. A loop involving several steps can also be made simply by having
the <strong>next-step</strong> of a step point to an ``earlier'' step.
</P>

<P>
For example, a simple RNA-Copy process could be defined like this:
</P>

<PRE>
(every RNA-Copy has
  (sub-steps (
    (a Step called "create" with
      (event-type-to-do (Create))
      (next-step (((the sub-steps of Self) called "attach"))))
    (a Step called "attach" with
      (event-type-to-do (Attach))
      (next-step (((the sub-steps of Self) called "move"))))
    (a Step called "move" with
      (event-type-to-do (Move))
      (test ('((the location of Self) = (the promotor region...))))
      (next-step ((:args NIL ((the sub-steps of Self) called "create"))))))))
</PRE>

<P>
This approach to defining loops is flexible since it allows multiple
entry points and multiple exit points under different
conditions. However a SME might find it hard to reason about the loop
because it is represented implicitly. One possibility is for an
explicit loop construct to be translated into this syntax for ease of
implementation (an idea that Peter referred to as a ``macro''). For
example the construct <BR>
 <PRE>repeat <EM>step1 step2 .. stepn</EM> until
<condition></PRE>
 could be translated into a loop in which <EM>stepn</EM> has a
conditional <strong>next-step</strong>.
</P>


<H3>Disjunctive steps</H3>

<P>
Disjunctive steps can be represented in terms of a conditional step
using an explicit non-deterministic test. Again an explicit macro
construct may help an SME, for example the SME might use the construct
<PRE> either <EM>take the 10 freeway</EM> or <EM>take the 5 freeway</EM></PRE> 

which could be translated to
<PRE>
(a Step with
  (test ('(equal (toss-a-coin) heads)))
  (next-step ((:args t   (<EM>take the 10 freeway</EM>))
              (:args NIL (<EM>take the 5 freeway</EM>)))))
</PRE> 
Here, <strong>toss-a-coin</strong> is a non-deterministic operation
that either yields <strong>heads</strong> or <strong>tails</strong>.
</P>

<h3>Other constructs that may be added later</h3>

There has also been some discussion about other constructs that may be
needed for May. We intend to include some way to handle "errors" that
can arise when processes are executed, using a small extension that
follows the approach already taken by Paul and his group.

There are some other potential extensions that have been discussed, but
which will probably not be included before the summer unless we see that
they are definitely needed. These include:
<ul>
<li> maintenance conditions (eg if an agent carries an object, then the
  agent must be holding the object for the entire period of the carry)
</li>
<li> Interpreting a richer language for dependencies between events,
including temporal dependencies (eg, two events must take place
concurrently, or must start at the same time). Note that we can already
represent these dependencies, since Allen's interval calculus is
available in the component library, but the effect that these construct
have on the simulators is currently undefined. 
</li>
<li> loop counters (eg, <em>repeat this step 10 times</em>). We currently
plan to implement counters through event effects.
</li>
<li> an explicit treatment of resources (eg, since the polymerase is a
  discrete, reusable resource it can only be used by one transcription
  event at a time, but is available for other transcription events after
  the current event is finished).
</li>
<li>
An ability for a process to "spawn" others, ie start a subprocess
without suspending action until the subprocess finishes. Over time an
unlimited number of subprocesses could be spawned. 
</li>
</ul>
