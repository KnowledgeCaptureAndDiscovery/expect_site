<h1>The SHAKEN action description language, using KM situations
 (SADL-S)</h1>
<p>Jim Blythe, Jan 28th 2002
<br>
With contributions from Pete, John, Paul, Gary, Pat, Bruce, Ken,
Yolanda, Jihie and others.
</p>

<p>
The SHAKEN system needs to be able to reason about processes that
contain loops, conditional steps, partially ordered steps and
disjunctive steps to meet our goals for year 2. The language described
here makes minimal necessary extensions to the process description
language already existing in KM that will allow this.  Because the
extensions are small, implementing them in each of the components of
SHAKEN should be straightforward, and further extensions can be made in
the future as needed. Because a process description will be shared
between several components, we need a very clear understanding of the
meaning of each construct in the language and also of how each component
can use the language.
</p>

<p>
This document summarizes the existing language, describes the extensions
and then shows how they are represented in KM. After this we mention
some constructs that may be added later, and link to an example based on
the December model of RNA transcription.
</p>

<p>
This version of SADL, called SADL-S, makes use of KM situations, and
does not require the distinction between events and steps used in the
original version, which can be found <a
href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/projects/rkf/sadl/old.html">here</a>
for comparison. SADL-S requires even less adaptation from the current
Shaken language, sometimes called SADL-lite, than original SADL. Process
descriptions that do not require loops or conditional next-events will
not need to be changed. Simulation code for analysis and
question-answering could also be left unchanged for those processes, but
a change will probably be required to simulate processes with loops and
conditional next-events.

and TAPIR can be found <a href="sadl-mapping.html">here</a>.

<h2>Events, sub-events in processes and event occurrences</h2>

<p>
Feel free to skip this section unless you are interested in how event
classes, events in processes and event occurrences in process
simulations are represented and distinguished.
</p>

<p>
An <em>event</em> like ``Move'' is represented in KM independently of
any particular process description. When a process description refers to
a Move, it creates an instance of the Move event. A process description
may have several, distinct Move events. Likewise an event in a process
description is linked to one or more following events with a
<strong>next-event</strong>, but the event description has no such
link. Finally when a process is executed, the actual execution of the
event is represented with respect to a KM situation in which the event
is executed, using the next-situation slot, which links a situation and
an event to the next situation. More details on how processes are linked
to situations during execution are discussed below, and more details
about situations can be found in the KM situations manual.
</p>

<p>
The reason to involve situations in the description of processes is that
when the processes include loops, we need a way to distinguish between
the properties of the world each time an event is simulated. Otherwise,
there would be no way to execute a loop more than once and then follow a
conditional exit from the loop.  In KM's model, skolem event instances
for sub-events are created when the parent event is created. Therefore
the same event instance must stand for each different execution of the
event during simulation of the process. The solution taken in SADL-S is
to view the different occurrences as applications of the same event
instance to different KM situations, recorded with the
<strong>next-situation</strong> slot. Any conditional tests that
determine which event to apply, or whether the event is applicable, are
to be made within this situation.
</p>

<h2>The existing action language</h2>

<p>
The current language for describing processes in KM makes use of events
that can have several sub-events. When an event in a process is to be
executed, all of its sub-events should be executed. An event in a
process may also include a <strong>next-event</strong> slot that
determines the next event to be executed. Here is an example:
</p>

<pre>
(every RNA-Transcription-Process has
   (sub-events
     (a Collide called "collide" with
       (next-event (((the sub-events of Self) called "recognize"))))
     (a Recognize called "recognize" with
       (next-event (((the sub-events of Self) called "copy"))))
     (a Copy called "copy" with
       (next-event (((the sub-events of Self) called "release"))))
     (a Release called "release")))
</pre>

<P>
The meaning of the <strong>sub-events</strong> and
<strong>next-event</strong> values on this example is that to execute an
RNA-Transcription-Process, the events called ``collide'', ``recognize'',
``copy'' and ``release'' are executed in that order.
</P>

<P>
No sub-event is explicitly designated the first event in this process.
Any event that is not the next-event for some other event could
potentially take place first.
</P>

<H2>Loops, disjunctive, conditional and partially ordered events</H2>

<P>
Events in a process are <em>partially ordered</em> if the order in which
the events take place is incompletely specified. A partial ordering over
events does not mean that the events can be executed simultaneously, only
that the full, linear ordering of the events is not specified. For
instance if two trucks need to go through a narrow tunnel, they cannot
both go through at the same time although we may not care which goes
first.
</P>

<P>
A process description has a <em>loop</em> if a sequence of events can be
repeated. For example in the description ``the polymerase moves forward
<bf>until</bf> the promoter region is reached'', the <em>move</em> event
is a single-event loop. Loops usually have a termination condition which
is tested each time the loop is completed.
</P>

<P>
A <em>conditional event</em> is one that is executed only if some
condition is met, for example ``if the gas tank is empty, fill it''. The
condition is usually tested against the world state immediately before
choosing to execute the event.
</P>

<P>
Two or more events are <em>disjunctive</em> if only one of them will
take place. For instance: ``to get to the zoo, <em>either</em> take the
10 freeway <em>or</em> take the 5 freeway''.
</P>

<P>
For ease of implementation, this language defines both loops and
disjunctive events in terms of conditional events, as I describe below.
</P>

<H2>Extending the existing KM representation</H2>

<H3>Partially ordered events</H3>

<P>
A concise way to represent partial orders is to allow more than one
event in the <strong>next-event</strong> field, with the intended
meaning that each event is executed eventually, but their order is
undefined. However, events do not take place simultaneously.  If two or
more events designate the same event <em>e</em> as
<strong>next-event</strong>, and the designating events have a common
ancestor, then <em>e</em> is considered a <em>join</em> event, meaning
that it cannot be executed until all the designating events have been
executed.
</P>

<P>
For example, suppose a process to move two trucks through a gate
requires first opening the gate, then moving both trucks (in any order),
then closing the gate. This can be represented as follows:

<PRE>
(every move-trucks-process has
  (sub-events
    (a open-gate with
      (next-event (((the sub-events of Self) called "move1")
                  ((the sub-events of Self) called "move2"))))
    (a move called "move1" with
      (next-event (((the sub-events of Self) called "close-gate"))))
    (a move called "move2" with
      (next-event (((the sub-events of Self) called "close-gate"))))
    (a close-gate called "close-gate" with)))
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
Since <strong>open-gate</strong> is the only event in the process that
is not the value of <strong>next-event</strong> for some other event, it
is the first event to be executed. After <strong>open-gate</strong>,
both <strong>move1</strong> and <strong>move2</strong> are
executable. Suppose <strong>move1</strong> is executed. Although the
<strong>next-event</strong> field is <strong>close-gate</strong>, this
event cannot be executed because <strong>move2</strong>, which also has
<strong>close-gate</strong> as its <strong>next-event</strong> field,
has not yet been executed. So after executing <strong>move1</strong>,
the order of the remaining events is uniquely determined.
</P>

<P>
If there is more than one event in a process that is not designated as
the <strong>next-event</strong> of some other event, they should be
interpreted as a set of potential first events that are unordered with
respect to each other.
</P>

<h3>Conditional events</h3>

<p>
The following syntax can be used to represent conditional events:
</p>

<pre>
(a move called "move" with
  (test ('((the location of Self) = (the promotor region...))))
  (next-event ((:args t   ((the sub-events of Self) called "recognize"))
              (:args NIL ((the sub-events of Self) called "move")))))
</pre>

<p>
Note that the test should be carried out in the KM situation that arises
from executing the events up to and including the current event. In this
way different subsequent events can be executed based on the state of
the simulation. See the manual on the KM Situation Mechanism for
details.
</p>

<p>
Either branch can be empty, indicating that there is no next event in
that case.
</p>

<h3>Loops</h3>

<p>
The above example implements a loop where the <strong>move</strong>
event is repeated until the test in the <strong>next-event</strong>
condition is met.  The condition plays the role of the termination
condition for the loop. A loop involving several events can also be made
simply by having the <strong>next-event</strong> of an event point to an
``earlier'' event.
</P>

<P>
For example, a simple RNA-Copy process could be defined like this:
</P>

<pre>
(every RNA-Copy has
  (sub-events (
    (a Create called "create" with
      (next-event (((the sub-events of Self) called "attach"))))
    (a Attach called "attach" with
      (next-event (((the sub-events of Self) called "move"))))
    (a Move called "move" with
      (test ('((the location of Self) = (the promotor region...))))
      (next-event ((:args NIL ((the sub-events of Self) called "create"))))))))
</pre>

<p>
This approach to defining loops is flexible since it allows multiple
entry points and multiple exit points under different
conditions. However a SME might find it hard to reason about the loop
because it is represented implicitly. One possibility is for an explicit
loop construct to be translated into this syntax for ease of
implementation (an idea that Peter referred to as a ``macro''). For
example the construct <br>
 <pre>repeat <em>event1 event2 .. eventn</em> until
<condition></pre>
 could be translated into a loop in which <em>eventn</em> has a
conditional <strong>next-event</strong>.
</p>


<h3>Disjunctive events</h3>

<P>
Disjunctive events can be represented in terms of a conditional event
using an explicit non-deterministic test. Again an explicit macro
construct may help an SME, for example the SME might use the construct

<pre> either <em>take the 10 freeway</em> or <em>take the 5 freeway</em></pre>

which could be translated to
<pre>
(a Event with
  (test ('(equal (toss-a-coin) heads)))
  (next-event ((:args t   (<EM>take the 10 freeway</EM>))
	     (:args NIL (<EM>take the 5 freeway</EM>)))))
</pre> 

Here, <strong>toss-a-coin</strong> is a non-deterministic operation
that either yields <strong>heads</strong> or <strong>tails</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Other constructs that may be added later</h3>

There has also been some discussion about other constructs that may be
needed for May. We intend to include some way to handle "errors" that
can arise when processes are executed, using a small extension that
follows the approach already taken by Paul and his group.

There are some other potential extensions that have been discussed, but
which will probably not be included before the summer unless we see that
they are definitely needed. These include:
<ul>
<li> maintenance conditions (eg if an agent carries an object, then the
  agent must be holding the object for the entire period of the carry)
</li>
<li> Interpreting a richer language for dependencies between events,
including temporal dependencies (eg, two events must take place
concurrently, or must start at the same time). Note that we can already
represent these dependencies, since Allen's interval calculus is
available in the component library, but the effect that these construct
have on the simulators is currently undefined. 
</li>
<li> loop counters (eg, <em>repeat this event 10 times</em>). We
currently plan to implement counters through event effects.
</li>
<li> an explicit treatment of resources (eg, since the polymerase is a
  discrete, reusable resource it can only be used by one transcription
  event at a time, but is available for other transcription events after
  the current event is finished).
</li>
<li>
An ability for a process to "spawn" others, ie start a subprocess
without suspending action until the subprocess finishes. Over time an
unlimited number of subprocesses could be spawned. 
</li>
</ul>
