   <title>Comparing SADL with other action languages</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<h1>Mappings between SADL and other action languages</h1>
<p>Jim Blythe, Nov 1 2001
</p>

<p>
SADL, the Shaken Action Description Language, is used to described
processes within Shaken system. A definition of the Shaken action
description language (SADL) can be found
<a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/projects/rkf/action-language.html">
here</a>.  This document compares SADL to the PDDL language as well as
to TAPIR used by the UMass Sim SHAKEN team and to the process ontology
within <a href="http://www.daml.org/services/">DAML-S</a>.  In this
comparison I focus on each as a process representation language and
ignore other aspects of the representations.  In general, the three
representations are compatible, allowing processes to be described in
terms of a number of sub-processes, which may be loosely or tightly
synchronised.  They have all been designed with slightly different
goals, and this affects the emphasis that each has placed on different
aspects of the language. However the languages have typically made
similar decisions about the aspects that they do cover; therefore this
document takes the form of a mapping of language features rather than a
comparison that highlights differences.
</p>

<p>
PDDL, which stands for Planning Domain Definition Language, was
originally developed as part of the AIPS98 planning competition, and was
intended to be a uniform domain representation for different AI planning
systems involved in the competition. More details can be found from <a
href="http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/dvm/">Drew McDermott's home
page.</a> PDDL allows a wide range of things to be said about actions
and plans; probably no single system can make use of them all. In this
comparison I focus on its language for describing actions in terms of
sub-actions.
</p>

<p>
DAML-S is an ontology to support services on the semantic web as part of
the DAML program. A process ontology is included to provide a detailed
model of services for coordination and monitoring. The latest version of
the ontology used for this comparison was 0.5, which can be found <a
href="http://www.daml.org/services/daml-s/2001/05/daml-s.html">here</a>.
The DAML-S ontology shares with PDDL the aim of supporting a wide range
of different systems but its focus is on web services rather than
automatic planning.
</p>

<p>
TAPIR is the process language used by the Sim SHAKEN group at UMass, led
by <a href="http://www-eksl.cs.umass.edu/~cohen/home.html">Paul
Cohen</a>. The group uses simulation to uncover information about
processes, and so this language has gone further than the others in
representing execution-time information such as handling interruptions.
</p>

<p>
SADL, the Shaken action description language, has been developed to
support the Shaken system for knowledge acquisition, to allow human
domain experts to specify information about processes. More information
about SADL can be found <a
href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/projects/rkf/action-language.html">
here</a>, and information about Shaken can be found
<a href="http://www.ai.sri.com/~rkf/">here</a>. SADL extends the action
representation already found in the KM representation language which is
used in Shaken. More details about KM can be found
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mfkb/RKF/km.html">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>Action language features that are compared</h2>

<p>
In each of these languages, a process is represented as having
preconditions and postconditions, and as having a collection of
sub-processes. Here I concentrate on the representation of a process as
a collection of sub-processes.  The representation languages are
compared across the following features of a process language: 
<ul>
<li>how the
language represents ordering constraints among sub-processes of a
process, 
<li>how it represents choices and alternative decompositions of a
process, including interruption handling, 
<li>and how it represents iteration within a process.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In the following tables I indicate the forms that can be used within
each language to produce the desired effect without explaining precisely
how the form is used. The reader may follow the links above to the
language descriptions for the details.
</p>

<h3>Ordering among sub-processes of a process</h3>

<table border="1">

<tr>
<th>Effect</th>
<th>PDDL</th>
<th>SADL</th>
<th>TAPIR</th>
<th>DAML+S</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>A linear sequence of processes</td>
<td>(<em>series</em> proc1 proc2 ...)</td>

<td>The <em>next-step</em> link between sub-steps in a process can be
used to create a linear sequence.</td>

<td> (<em>:do</em> proc1 proc2 ...) </td>

<td>The <em>Sequence</em> construct holds a list of processes.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>An unordered set of processes</td>

<td>(<em>parallel</em> proc1 proc2 ...) implies no ordering
constraints.</td>

<td>The <em>sub-step</em> link points to each sub-process, no
<em>next-step</em> link is used. With no temporal links, the processes
are assumed to take place one at a time but in no specified
order. Allen's interval calculus can be attached to processes to force
parallel execution.
</td>

<td>
Either (<em>:unordered</em> proc1 proc2 ...) or (<em>:parallel</em>
proc1 proc2 ...). <em>:unordered</em> implies that the subprocesses are
executed one at a time but in no specified order. <em>:parallel</em>
implies that the subprocesses may take place concurrently.
</td>

<td>Either <em>Unordered</em> or <em>Split</em>. <em>Unordered</em>
implies that the processes are executed one at a time but in no
specified order. <em>Split</em> implies that the subprocesses take place
concurrently.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Combinations, including arbitrary DAG orderings</td> <td>
<em>series</em> and <em>parallel</em> may be nested. The
<em>constraint</em> form can also be used to assign tags to the
beginning and end of a process which can then be ordered with respect to
other processes, allowing arbitrary DAGs to be represented.
</td>

<td>The <em>next-step</em> link can be used to form any DAG</td>

<td> <em>:do</em>, <em>:parallel</em> and <em>:unordered</em> can be
nested to create arbitrary orderings.
</td>

<td><em>Sequence</em>, <em>Unordered</em>, <em>Split</em> and
<em>Split+Join</em> can be nested to create arbitrary orderings.
</td>

</table>

<h3>Conditional and alternative decompositions of a process</h3>

<table border="1">

<tr>
<th>Effect</th>
<th>PDDL</th>
<th>SADL</th>
<th>TAPIR</th>
<th>DAML+S</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Conditional sub-processes in the decomposition of a process.</td>
<td>
The <em>in-context</em> form specifies conditions on the subprocesses
that appear in a decomposition.
</td>

<td>
The <em>next-step</em> link can be made conditional on the outcome of a
test applied to the state at the time that the step is to be chosen
</td>

<td>The <em>:when</em> construct.</td>

<td>
The <em>If-then-else</em> construct.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>Choice between alternative decompositions of a process
</td>

<td> <em>choice</em></td>

<td> The test in a conditional <em>next-step</em> link is defined as
non-deterministic, representing that a system choice is to be made.
</td>

<td>&nbsp;</td>

<td>
<em>Choice</em> expresses that a subset of the processes described is
chosen and executed. The precise manner is to be determined in
subclasses of <em>Choice</em> that are yet to be described as of DAML-S
version 0.5
</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Interruption handling: actions to take in response to failure
messages from subprocesses during execution</td>

<td>&nbsp;</td>

<td>Currently not represented. There are plans to incorporate the
technique used in TAPIR</td>

<td>The <em>:handle</em> construct specifies subprocesses to be
instantiated when a specified message is received from a sibling or
child subprocess during execution. The <em>:generate</em> construct
specifies a message to send to the parent process.
</td>

<td>
Behaviour during execution is specified in the <em>Process Control
ontology</em> in DAML-S, which is not described in version 0.5
</td>

</tr>

</table>

<h2>Iterative processes</h2>

<table border="1">

<tr>
<th>Effect</th>
<th>PDDL</th>
<th>SADL</th>
<th>TAPIR</th>
<th>DAML+S</th>
</tr>

<tr>

<td>A process with an iterative loop</td>

<td>The PDDL description does not discuss iteration in an action's
expansion. In the spirit of the AI planning systems that inspired PDDL,
this can probably be achieved by recursively referring to the parent
process in the specification of sub-processes. Iterative expansion would
terminate with a <em>Choice</em> or <em>in-context</em> form as
described above.
</td>

<td>The <em>next-step</em> links can form a loop, with loop unrolling at
execution time managed by instantiating different step instances on each
iteration around the loop. A conditional <em>next-step</em> link can be
used to represent the loop's termination condition.
</td>

<td>The <em>:repeat-:until</em> construct specifies a simple loop which
can be combined with other language constructs.
</td>

<td>
The <em>Iterate</em> construct represents a process whose next process
property has the same value as the current process. The
<em>Repeat-Until</em> and <em>Repeat-While</em> subclasses use the
<em>If-Then-Else</em> construct to manage termination.
</td>
