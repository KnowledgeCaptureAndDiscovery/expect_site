<H1><A>Architecture</A></H1>
<P>
The architecture of the EXPECT interface is shown in Figure 1. The
interface works as a client in a basic client-server architecture
where the server is a program running EXPECT. The server is currently
implemented in CommonLisp.

<H2><A>Hardware and Software Decisions</A></H2>
<P>
The following decisions were made with respect to the software and
hwardware to be used in the interface:
<P>
<ul>

<li> <b> Active design document </b> This design document is an
active (dynamic) description of the current design. Whenever the
interface is finished, it will be possible to start it from here. The
document refers to some files that have specifications of syntax and
other features used in EXPECT.

<li> <b> Java Client </b> We use Java for coding the client. <a
href="http:http://www.symantec.com/">Symantec's</a> <a
href="http:http://www.symantec.com/vcafe/">Visual Cafe</a> is being
used as the primary IDE for developing the program. We are using <a
href="http: http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/index.html">JDK
1.1</a> (the latest available is currently JDK 1.1.3), and we will
change to JDK 1.2 as soon as it is available and Visual Cafe is made
compatible with it.

<li> <b> Graphical Libraries </b> We are currently using the graphical
object classes from Symantec. We intend to migrate to using the Java
Foundation Clas Library (JFC, made by Sun and Netscape, and also known
as <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/swingdoc-current/doc/index.html">Swing</A>) as soon as it becomes available.

<li> <b> General Libraries </b> We use whenever necessary a library
called <a
href="http:http://www.objectspace.com/jgl/jgl_overview.html">JGL</a>,
freely available and widely used, that provides (among other things)
for data structures such as sequential containers, sets, maps, and
queues; reusable algorithms such as sorting, union, and intersection;
and lightweight object persistence.

<li> <b> Grapher </b> In order to display tree-like structures in the
EXPECT interface, we are using a Java grapher developed by <a
href="http:http://www.isi.edu/~zhang/">Wayne Zhang</a> as part of the
<a href="http:http://panda.isi.edu:80/jake/">JAKE</a> tool.

<li> <b> Client-server communication </b> The initial solution is to
use sockets over TCP/IP connections, and building our own API over
it. We will pass structured data through the sockets. To parse it on
the Java side, we use <a
href="http:http://www.suntest.com/JavaCC/">JavaCC</a>. However, this
is not an ideal solution.  We would like to use CORBA (and more
specifically IIOP) to handle the client-server
comunication. Unfortunately, while the are already ORBs for Java,
there is no good ORB for CommonLisp, so we have to wait and see if the
market evolves and a solution comes up (hopefully soon).

<li> <b> Hypertext </b> A central part of the interface is the use of
a real hypertext system, more flexible than the one allowed by Web
Browsers. Since there was no such system available in Java, we
developed one. Dilip Jain created a hypertext Java class based on a
similar (but less flexible) class that displays a subset of HTML. This
HTML displaying class is part of of the <a
href="http:http://w3.nai.net/~rvdi/jhelp/jhelp.html">jHelp</a>
package, created by William Giel, who gracefully sent us his source
code.  jHelp was created originally to build help systems, and we are
adapting only part of the code. It supports most of HTML2.

We call the extension of HTML handled by our hypertext package
"JTML". JTML has an additional tag called "popup", where one can
specify a popup window to appear when an item is clicked. The tag is
parameterized, so for example: <br>
<pre> &lt;popup type="Concept"&gtdomain-concept&lt;/popup&gt </pre><br>
refers to a popup menu called "Concept"; the set of available menus in
a given system is specified in Java. Below you can find examples of
JTML files, linked to the specification of how the interface should
display EXPECT objects. In the future, we may want to redo the
adaptation departing from a full HTML-displaying package, if such
class becomes publicly available.

<li> <b> Editor </b> EXPECT asks for very specific and powerful
editors that reflect EXPECT's repreentation language as closely as
possible. However, in a first phase, all editors in the EXPECT
interface are only "dumb", generic, Java text panes. As soon as Swing
becomes available, we are going to use a more powerful text editing
tool available in that package. In the long run, we will create
specialized editors. 
</ul>


<H1><A>Basic GUI Design</A></H1>
<P>

The basic structure of the EXPECT interface is shown in Figure 2. The
user starts from window were s/he can select or create a knowledge
base (KB) to work. Each knowledge base opened has a control panel,
from where all windows displaying elements of that KB can be
accessed.


<P><A NAME="figure2"> <STRONG>Figure 2:</STRONG> </A>Basic
organization of the windows in the EXPECT interface.
<p>
<P><IMG ALIGN=center ALT="figure2" SRC="interface-window-organiz.gif">
<P>

From the KB control panel, the user can open or access four basic
windows, each of them controlling a type of component used in EXPECT:
domain (concepts, relations, instances), methods, problem-solving
(tree) and agenda. These four windows share the same structure. They
have two panels divided vertically. The panel on the left displays the
structure, and the panel on the right display elements of this
structure, as set in Table 3.
<p>

<p>
<TABLE ALIGN=center BORDER>
<caption>Table 3: Structures and elements in EXPECT.</caption>
<tr><th align=left>STRUCTURE <th align=left>ELEMENTS <TD></tr>
<tr><td>Goal tree </TD> <td>methods (capabilities)</td></tr>
<tr><td>PS/EXE tree </TD> <td>PS/EXE nodes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Concept/relation tree </TD><TD> concepts, relations (instances)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Agenda </TD><TD> agenda Items</td></tr>
</TABLE>
<P>

From each of the element or structure-diaplying window, all presented
or references elements are presented with hypertext links, that is
clicked lead to their presentation. In principle, the presentation of
an item is made in the appropriate window (see Table
3). Alternatively, (see Figure 2), the popu menu accessible from the
hypertext link enables the user to request to either open a separate
(smaller) window to browse the element, or open a separate window to
edit the element (editing is done always in a separate editing
window).

<H2><A>Contents of the windows presenting elements</A></H2>
<P>

Each window presenting an element contains a list of data about that
element. This list can be set up by the user (using Preferences) from
a basic list of possible types of information pertaining to each type
of element. Below, we list the possible types of data that can be
displayed in the presentation of each type of element. For each item,
a JTML file exemplifying a disply of all the available data is
offered.

<H2><A>Data structures</A></H2>
<P>

The definition of the objects in the client is determined in principle
by EXPECT. There is one class per each type of element/component in
EXPECT. The class contains the same slots that are defined for that
element/component in EXPECT. These slots are duplicated in the client:
one slot holds the contents of the type specified by the server
(perhaps including some adaptation), and one slots holds the JTML
string that is used to display that same contents. Specific slots can
be added by the client in order to store additional display
information about the EXPECT components, which is specific to the
client.

In the class definition in Java, all slots are private. Methods to
access/set the slot values are defined for each slot. These basic
methods will not make assumptions about the actual behaviour of the
interface, or the specific client-server model chosen. More complex
functions (e.g. to update some slots when a certain slot value is set)
may defined if needed.

<UL>
<LI> The definition of the contents of a method is defined in the file
/shared/plans.lisp, in the definition of the structure used to
represent a method (plan). Additional slots are defined by the client
to store cross-indexing information. The slots are as follows:


<TABLE BORDER>

<H2><A>Client-Server Communication API</A></H2>
<P>

The communication is made through sockets. There may be several
sockets open at the same time, and the code will try to explore the
inherent parallelism in this setting by using threads. However, it
will be assumed that every transaction is going to occur using one
socket only.<P>

All the information in the transaction is going to be
"serialized". The serialization protocol is as follows.

The character sequence <SAMP>#?</SAMP> indicates the beginning and end
of a transaction request or answer. A character <SAMP>#</SAMP> is used
as a separator. The transaction request string has the format:<P>

<SAMP>#?</SAMP><VAR>request-name</VAR><SAMP></SAMP><VAR>parameter-list</VAR><SAMP>#?</SAMP><P>

The <VAR>request-name</VAR> contains the name of the request
(alphanumeric only, with dashes, e.g., <SAMP>get-concept</SAMP>). The
<VAR>request-parameters</VAR> is a string-encoded version of the list of
parameters in the request.<P>

The transaction answer string has the format: <P>

<SAMP>#?</SAMP><VAR>parameter-list</VAR><SAMP>#?</SAMP><P>

The
<VAR>parameter-list</VAR> is a string-encoded version of the list of
parameters in the answer.<P>

The encoding of the <VAR>parameter-lists</VAR> obeys the following
rules:
<P>

<UL>
<li> Each parameter is prefixed with an indication of its type, that
also works as a separator between parameters. The prefixes are
summarized in the table below.

<li> All parameters are either numbers, strings, booleans, symbols,
lists or s-expressions.

<li> Numbers and strings are represented as they normally are in Java
or Lisp, but no quotes are added. In order not to cause any
confusions, strings that contain the character <SAMP>#</SAMP> must
escape it as: <SAMP>\#</SAMP>), and cannot start with the character
<SAMP>-</SAMP> in order to avoid confusing with a number. Strings are
prefixed with <SAMP>#S</SAMP>. Numbers are prefixed with <SAMP>#N</SAMP>.

<li> Symbols are represented by their symbol-names, prefixed with
<SAMP>#Y</SAMP>.

<li> Since Lisp does not have an explicit boolean type booleans are
sent as symbols --- NIL means false, T means true.

<li> Lisp s-expressions (sexp) are sent as a single string. For
example, a result-type <VAR>(set-of boolean)</VAR> is sent as a string
<SAMP>(set-of boolean)</SAMP>. They are prefixed with
<SAMP>#X</SAMP>. Some of them and stored in the Java side as strings,
while others are decoded ito real JGL lists.

</UL>


Not all data types in Lisp or Java can be transmitted as they normally
are. The correspondence between the types in each side (Lisp, Java)
and in the transmission are as follows:
