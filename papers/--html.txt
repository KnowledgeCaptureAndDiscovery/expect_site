"Explicit Representations of Problem-Solving Strategies
to Support Knowledge Acquisition".
<i>Proceedings of the Thirteen National Conference on Artificial 
Intelligence (AAAI-96)</i>, Portland, OR, August 4-8, 1996.
<P>

Abstract: 
Role-limiting approaches support knowledge acquisition (KA) by centering 
knowledge base construction on common types of tasks or domain-independent 
problem-solving strategies.  Within a particular problem-solving strategy, 
domain-dependent knowledge plays specific roles.  A KA tool then helps a user 
to fill these roles.  Although role-limiting approaches are useful for 
guiding KA, they are limited because they only support users in filling 
knowledge roles that have been built in by the designers of the KA system.  
EXPECT takes a different approach to KA by representing problem-solving 
knowledge explicitly, and deriving from the current knowledge base the 
knowledge gaps that must be resolved by the user during KA.  This paper 
contrasts role-limiting approaches and EXPECT's approach, using the 
propose-and-revise strategy as an example.  EXPECT not only supports users in 
filling knowledge roles, but also provides support in 1) adapting the 
problem-solving strategy, 2) changing the types of information to be 
acquired about a knowledge role, 3) adding new knowledge roles, and 
4) acquiring additional background information about the domain needed 
by the knowledge-based system.  EXPECT's guidance changes as the knowledge 
base changes, providing a more flexible approach to knowledge acquisition.  
This work provides evidence supporting the need for explicit representations 
in building knowledge-based systems.

"Flexible Knowledge Acquisition Through 
Explicit Representation of Knowledge Roles".
<i>1996 AAAI Spring Symposium on Acquisition, Learning, and Demonstration:
Automating Tasks for Users</i>, Stanford, CA, March 1996.
<P>

Abstract: 
A system that acquires knowledge from a user should be able to
reflect upon the knowledge that it has --- at each moment --- and
understand what kinds of new knowledge it needs to learn. For the
past two decades, research in the area of knowledge acquisition has
been moving towards systems that have access to richer
representations of knowledge about their task.  This paper reviews
some well-known knowledge acquisition tools representative of this
trend.  It also describes our recent work in EXPECT, a system with
explicit representations of knowledge about the task and the domain 
that supports knowledge acquisition for a wider range of tasks and
applications than its predecessors.  We hope our observations will
be useful to researchers in user interfaces and in machine learning
concerned with acquiring information from users.

"EXPECT: A User-Centered Environment for the Development  
and Adaptation of Knowledge-Based Planning Aids".
<i>???????</i>, .
<P>

Abstract: 
EXPECT provides an environment for developing knowledge-based
systems that allows end-users to add new knowledge without needing
to understand the details of system organization and
implementation.  The key to EXPECT's approach is that it
understands the structure of the knowledge-based system being
built: how it solves problems and what knowledge it needs to
support problem-solving. EXPECT uses this information to guide
users in maintaining the knowledge-based system. We have used
EXPECT to develop a tool for evaluating transportation plans.

"EXPECT: Explicit Representations for Flexible Acquisition".
<i>In Proceedings of the Ninth Knowledge Acquisition for 
Knowledge-Based Systems Workshop</i>, February 26-March 3, 1995.
Banff, Alberta, Canada. <P>

Abstract: To create more powerful knowledge acquisition systems, we
not only need better acquisition tools, but we need to change the
architecture of the knowledge based systems we create so that their
structure will provide better support for acquisition.  Current
acquisition tools permit users to modify factual knowledge but they
provide limited support for modifying problem solving knowledge. 
In this paper, we argue that this limitation (and others) stem from
the use of incomplete models of problem solving knowledge and
inflexible specification of the interdependencies between problem
solving and factual knowledge.  We describe the EXPECT architecture
which addresses these problems by providing an explicit
representation for problem solving knowledge and intent. Using this
more explicit representation, EXPECT can automatically derive the
interdependencies between problem solving and factual knowledge. 
By deriving these interdependencies from the structure of the
system itself EXPECT supports more flexible and powerful knowledge
acquisition.

"Transaction-Based Knowledge Acquisition: 
Complex Modifications Made Easier".
<i>In Proceedings of the Ninth Knowledge Acquisition for 
Knowledge-Based Systems Workshop</i>, February 26-March 3, 1995.
Banff, Alberta, Canada. <P>

Abstract: Our goal is to build knowledge acquisition tools that 
support users in making a broad range of changes to a knowledge 
base, including both factual and problem-solving knowledge.  These 
changes may require several individual modifications to various 
parts of the knowledge base, that need to be carefully coordinated 
to prevent users from introducing errors in the knowledge base.
Thus, it becomes essential that our KA tools understand the 
consequences of each kind of change that the user may initiate, 
detect any harmful side-effects that can be introduced in the
system, and guide the user in resolving them.  To address this 
issue, we have developed a transaction-based approach to knowledge
acquisition that can support users in making complex modifications
to a knowledge base.  A transaction is a sequence of changes that
together modify some aspect of the behavior of a knowledge-based
system, and that when only partially carried out may leave the 
knowledge base in an undesirable state.  If a user executes a
transaction partially, the knowledge acquisition tool must provide 
guidance to finish it and support the user in achieving the desired
modification.  This paper also describes our work in extending 
EXPECT's knowledge acquisition tool to support transaction-based 
mechanisms.  EXPECT tracks the possible problems that arise
as a consequence of each individual change to the knowledge base,
keeps information about the context of each change, and uses this 
context to resolve the problems detected and to request the user's 
intervention if additional information is needed.

"Knowledge Refinement in a Reflective Architecture".
<i>Proceedings of the Twelfth National Conference of Artificial 
Intelligence (AAAI-94)</i>,  Seattle, WA, August 1994. <P>

Abstract: 
A knowledge acquisition tool should provide a user with
maximum guidance in extending and debugging a knowledge base, by preventing
inconsistencies and knowledge gaps that may arise inadvertently.  Most
current acquisition tools are not very flexible in that they are built
for a predetermined inference structure or problem-solving mechanism,
and the guidance they provide is specific to that inference structure
and hard-coded by their designer.  This paper focuses on EXPECT, a
reflective architecture that supports knowledge acquisition 
based on an explicit analysis of the structure of a knowledge-based	system,
rather than on a fixed set of acquisition guidelines.
EXPECT's problem solver is tightly integrated with LOOM, a
state-of-the-art knowledge representation system.  Domain facts and
goals are represented declaratively, and the problem solver keeps
records of their functionality within the task domain.  When the user
corrects the system's knowledge, EXPECT tracks any possible
implications of this change in the overall system and cooperates with
the user to correct any potential problems that may arise. The key to
the flexibility of this knowledge acquisition tool is that it
adapts its guidance as the knowledge bases evolve in response to
changes introduced by the user.

"Towards Method-Independent Knowledge Acquisition".
<i>Knowledge Acquisition</i>, , Special issue on
Machine Learning and Knowledge Acquisition, 
Volume 6 Number 2, June 1994.
<P>

Abstract: 
Rapid prototyping and tool reusability have pushed knowledge
acquisition research to investigate method-specific knowledge
acquisition tools appropriate for predetermined problem-solving
methods.  We believe that method-dependent knowledge acquisition is 
not the only
approach.  The aim of our research is to develop powerful yet
versatile machine learning mechanisms that can be incorporated into
general-purpose but practical knowledge acquisition tools.  This paper
shows through examples the practical advantages of this approach.  In
particular, we illustrate how existing knowledge can be used to
facilitate knowledge acquisition through analogy mechanisms within a
domain and across domains.
Our sample knowledge acquisition dialogues with a
domain expert illustrate which parts of the process are addressed by
the human and which parts are automated by the tool, in a synergistic
cooperation for knowledge-base extension and refinement.  The paper
also describes briefly the EXPECT problem-solving architecture
that facilitates this approach to knowledge acquisition.
