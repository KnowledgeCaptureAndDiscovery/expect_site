<B> Abstract: </B> 
Learning from experimentation allows a system to acquire planning 
domain knowledge by correcting its knowledge when an action execution 
fails.  Experiments are designed and planned to bring the world to a state
where a hypothesis (e.g., that an operator is missing a precondition) 
can be tested.  When planning an experiment, the planner must take 
into account the interactions between the execution of the main plan 
and the execution of the experiment plans, since after the experiment 
it must continue to carry on its main task.  In order for planners 
to work in such environments where they can be given several tasks, 
they must take into account the interactions between them.  A usual assumption 
in current planning systems is that they are given a single task (or set 
of goals to achieve).  However, a plan that 
may seem adequate for a task in isolation may make other tasks harder 
(or even impossible) to achieve.  Different tasks 
may compete for resources, execute irreversible actions that make
other tasks unachievable, or set the world in undesirable states.  
This paper discusses what these interactions are and presents how the
problem was adressed in EXPO, an implemented system that acquires 
domain knowledge for planning through experimentation.

<B> Abstract: </B> 
EXPECT provides an environment for developing knowledge-based
systems that allows end-users to add new knowledge without needing
to understand the details of system organization and
implementation.  The key to EXPECT's approach is that it
understands the structure of the knowledge-based system being
built: how it solves problems and what knowledge it needs to
support problem-solving. EXPECT uses this information to guide
users in maintaining the knowledge-based system. We have used
EXPECT to develop a tool for evaluating transportation plans.

"Applying a General-Purpose Planning and Learning Architecture
to Process Planning".

<B> Abstract: </B> 
Process planning poses significant computational requirements
due to the variety of alternative processes, their complexity, and
their interactions.  General-purpose planners are generally not considered
a practical approach, and most current research focuses on
special-purpose planning systems.
Research within the PRODIGY framework aims to provide
expressive general-purpose planners together with
learning algorithms that can improve their efficiency, the
accuracy of their domain model, and the quality of their plans.
Process planning is one of the large-scale complex domains that
we have implemented in PRODIGY to demonstrate the feasibility
of our approach.
Our current model of process planning is still
far from comprehensive and is limited in many ways,
but it reflects many of the complexities involved in the task.
This paper describes
how PRODIGY learns control knowledge, acquires domain knowledge,
and improves the quality of its plans for this application domain
using general-purpose planning and learning algorithms.

"On Analyzing Planning Applications".
<i>AAAI Fall Symposium on "Planning and Learning: 
On to Real Applications"</i>, 
New Orleans, LA, November 1994.
(<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/~gil/papers/gil-linster-fss94.ps">Postscript file </A>) 
<P>

<B> Abstract: </B> 
It is hard to evaluate in current planning applications 
what aspects of the approach address each of the complexities of the problem.
This results from the fact that
the planning community is lacking a vocabulary to describe planning tasks 
and applications.
This work is an effort towards descriptions of planning applications 
in terms that are useful 1) to extract conclusions from particular implementations,
2) to facilitate cross-comparisons among different planners applied to the same problem,
and 3) to facilitate comparisons among different tasks.
We analyze the Sisyphus experience, a 3-year old and still 
ongoing effort in the knowledge acquisition community
to enable a cross-comparison of
their application systems as they implement a common pre-stated problem description.
Based on this experience, we propose a set of dimensions to describe applications that
distinghish between descriptions of the properties of the architecture, 
the type of problem, and the data sets.
We show how they can be used to
produce useful distictions in the context of the first Sisyphus task, 
which was an office assignment problem.
Our hope is that the same dimensions will be useful to other researchers
in describing and characterizing their applications, as well as a
useful point of comparison for future Sisyphus efforts.

"Learning by Experimentation: 
Incremental Refinement of Incomplete Planning Domains".
<i>Proceedings of the Eleventh International
Conference on Machine Learning</i>July 10-13, 1994, Rutgers, NJ.
(<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/~gil/papers/gil-mlc94.ps">Postscript file </A>) 
<P>

<B> Abstract: </B> 
Building a knowledge base requires iterative refinement to 
correct imperfections that keep lurking after each new version of the system.
This paper concentrates on the automatic refinement of 
incomplete domain models for planning systems,
presenting both a methodology for addressing the problem
and empirical results.
Planning knowledge may be refined automatically 
through direct interaction with the environment.
Missing conditions cause unreliable predictions of action outcomes.
Missing effects cause unreliable predictions of facts about the state.
We present a practical approach based on
continuous and selective interaction with the 
environment that pinpoints the type of
fault in the domain knowledge that causes 
any unexpected 
behavior of the environment, 
and resorts to experimentation 
when additional information is needed to correct the fault.
Our approach has been implemented in EXPO, a system that uses PRODIGY
as a baseline planner and improves its domain knowledge in several domains
when initial domain knowledge is up to
50% incomplete.
The empirical results presented show that EXPO 
dramatically improves its 
prediction accuracy and reduces the amount of unreliable action outcomes.

"Domain-Specific Criteria to Direct and Evaluate Planning Systems".

Laboratories Planning Initiative</i>, February 21-25, 1994, Tucson, AZ.

<B> Abstract: </B> 
This document is the result of a joint effort to understand what are relevant
factors to consider when there are several possible courses of action (COAs)
to accomplish a Non-combatant Evacuation Operation (NEO) military mission.
These relevant factors are useful for generation and evaluation of COAs and
provide the basis for a good decision in selecting a COA.  The document
compiles the relevant factors from the perspective of logistics that are
useful to evaluate whether or not alternative proposed COAs can be supported
logistically, and which ones seem to be better alternatives compared to the
others.  The ultimate goal of this joint effort is to use these factors to
automate the evaluation and comparison of COAs and use the comparison to
determine what are critical aspects of a COA that may be changed to produce a
better option with a generative planner.  We discuss how we envision
using EXPECT and O-Plan2 for this purpose.

This document describes methods for evaluating research and
development progress in automated planning.
It is meant as a resource for the members of the research community
participating in the planning initiative.
The document attempts to explain the goals of evaluation and provide
concrete examples of evaluation methods that are currently being used.
It also serves as a source of ideas for designing new methods for 
evaluation and improving old ones.

"Learning New Planning Operators by Exploration and Experimentation".
<i>Proceedings of the AAAI Workshop on Learning Action
  Models</i>, Washington, DC, July 1993.
(<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/~gil/papers/gil-aaaiwks93.ps">Postscript file </A>) 
<P>

<B> Abstract: </B> 
This paper addresses a computational approach to the automated
acquisition of domain knowledge for planning systems via 
experimentation with the environment.  Our previous work has shown 
how existing incomplete operators can be refined by adding missing 
preconditions and effects.   Here we develop additional methods to 
acquire new operators such as direct analogy with existing operators,
decomposition of monolithic operators into meaningful sub-operators, 
and experimentation with partially-specified operators.

"Acquiring Domain Knowledge for Planning by Experimentation".
<i>Ph.D. Thesis</i>, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon
University, Pittsburgh PA 15213.  August 1992.  
Available as CMU Technical Report CMU-CS-92-175.
<P>

<B> Abstract: </B> 
In order for autonomous systems to interact with their environment in an
intelligent way, they must be given the ability to adapt and learn
incrementally and deliberately. It is virtually impossible to devise 
and hand code all potentially relevant domain knowledge for complex 
dynamic tasks. This thesis describes a framework to acquire domain
knowledge for planning by failure-driven experimentation with the 
environment.  The initial domain knowledge in the system is an 
approximate model for planning in the environment, defining the
system's expectations.  The framework exploits the characteristics 
of planning domains in order to search the space of plausible 
hypotheses without the need for additional background knowledge to
build causal explanations for expectation failures.   Plans are 
executed while the external environment is monitored, and 
differences between the internal state and external observations 
are detected by various methods each correlated with a typical 
cause for the expectation failure.  The methods also construct a 
set of concrete hypotheses to repair the knowledge deficit.
After being heuristically filtered, each hypothesis is tested in turn
with an experiment.  After the experiment is designed,
a plan is constructed to achieve the situation required to 
carry out the experiment.  The experiment plan must meet 
constraints such as minimizing plan length and negative 
interference with the main goals.  The thesis describes a set of 
domain-independent constraints for experiments and their 
incorporation in the planning search space.  After the execution
of the plan and the experiment, observations are collected to conclude if
the experiment was successful or not.  Upon success, the hypothesis is
confirmed and  the domain knowledge is adjusted.  Upon failure, the
experimentation process is iterated on the remaining hypotheses 
until success or until no more hypotheses are left to be considered.  
This framework has shown to be an effective way to address incomplete 
planning knowledge and is demonstrated in a system called EXPO, 
implemented on the PRODIGY planning architecture.
The effectiveness and efficiency of EXPO's methods is 
empirically demonstrated in several domains, including a large-scale
process planning task, where the planner can recover from situations 
missing up to 50% of domain knowledge through repeated experimentation.

"A Specification of Manufacturing Processes for Planning".
<i>Technical Report CMU-CS-91-179</i>, School of Computer Science, 
Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh PA 15213.
(<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/~gil/papers/gil-processp91.ps">Postscript file </A>) 
<P>

<B> Abstract: </B> 
Much research is being done on the 
automation of manufacturing processes.
The planning component in the production stage is very significant, 
due to the variety of alternative processes, their complexity, and 
their interactions.
This document describes a specification of some manufacturing processes,
including the machining, 
joining, and finishing of parts. 
The aim of this specification is not to be comprehensive or detailed, but to
present the AI community with a model of a complex and realistic 
application, and to use it to demonstrate
the feasibility of effective implementations of 
large-scale complex domains in a general-purpose architecture.
This specification has been successfully demonstrated in the PRODIGY 
architecture, and is one of the largest domains 
available for general-purpose planners.<P>
