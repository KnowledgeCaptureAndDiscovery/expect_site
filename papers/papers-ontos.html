<B> Abstract: </B>
If we could share knowledge across systems, costs would be
reduced.  However, because knowledge bases are typically constructed from
scratch, each with their own idiosyncratic structure, sharing is difficult.
Recent research has focused on the use of ontologies to promote sharing. An
ontology is a hierarchically structured set of terms for describing a domain
that can be used as a skeletal foundation for a knowledge base.  If two
knowledge bases are built on a common ontology, knowledge can be more readily
shared, since they share a common underlying structure.  This paper outlines a
set of desiderata for ontologies, and then describes how we have used a
large-scale (50,000+ concept) ontology to develop a specialized,
domain-specific ontology semi-automatically.  We then discuss the relation
between ontologies and the process of developing a system, arguing that to be
useful, an ontology needs to be created as a "living document", whose
development is tightly integrated with the system's.  We conclude with a
discussion of Web-based ontology tools we are developing to support this
approach.
