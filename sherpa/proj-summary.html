TITLE OF EFFORT:  Knowledge Acquisition for Large Knowledge Bases:
 Integrating Problem-Solving Methods and Ontologies into Applications

OBJECTIVE:  The HPKB program seeks to develop large, shared, and
reusable libraries of ontologies and problem-solving methods which
will ease the construction and maintenance of large knowledge based
systems.  A critical facet of HPKB is to understand how these
ontologies and problem solving methods can be brought together to
produce applications and to develop tools and techniques that support
the process.  Our work will provide knowledge acquisition tools for
building and maintaining knowledge-based systems that understand how
knowledge in the libraries is used in the construction of applications
and as a result can support users to search the libraries for useful
knowledge, to update the application when the shared ontologies are
changed, and to add runtime knowledge needed by the application.

APPROACH:  Our work builds on the current EXPECT framework (funded by
the DARPA/Rome Laboratory Planning Initiative) for building and
maintaining knowledge-based systems, which already provides mechanisms
for capturing the interdependencies that arise as ontologies and
problem-solving methods are put together to construct a knowledge
based system and also provides knowledge acquisition tools to support
users in extending the system's knowledge base.  We will extend the
framework in three main areas.  First, we will develop EXCALIBUR, a
knowledge acquisition framwework based on EXPECT which will include an
enhanced representation language and knowledge compiler.  Second, we
will develop LIBRA, a framework for representing problem-solving
methods, and will populate it with an extensive library of methods.
LIBRA will include tools for indexing and selecting these methods.
Third, we will develop SHERPA, a Knowledge Acquisition Mediator, that
will support knowledge acquisition for systems developed outside of
the EXCALIBUR framework.

PROGRESS:  We have participated actively in the evaluation of
challenge problems for the HPKB program.  We have started
collaborating with other groups to develop standards for representing
problem solving method libraries.

PRODUCTS:  None.

FY97 ACCOMPLISHMENTS:  New start.

FY98 PLANS:
- Develop and demonstrate a prototype of LIBRA's indexing tools
- Develop the EXCALIBUR architecture and incorporate to
integrated KB development environment
- Participate in the program's efforts to develop standards
for representing problem solving method libraries
- Participate in challenge problems design and evaluation
efforts

TECHNOLOGY TRANSITION:  New start.

10.  FUNDING PROFILE:

10.1. Current contract:  1,794,725

10.2. Options (Not exercised):  N/A

10.3. Total funds provided to date for all years 50,000.

	Total funds expended to date 8,558.

	As of date 30-Jun-97.

10.4. Date total current funding will be expended: 31 DEC 1997

10.5. Funds required in FY98: 200,001

11.  ANYTHING ELSE YOU NEED (from DARPA):

NOTE:  We made an agreement with Dave Gunning, HPKB's Program Manager, that
we would start the contract when the HPKB program started but that we would
have a small level of funding (50K) in the first year so that we could
finalize our work on other existing contracts.  This is why the funding
requested for next FY is significantly higher, since we are planning to
increase the percentage of time on this contract for all key personnel
involved.
