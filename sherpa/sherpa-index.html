<H1>Guidance for Knowledge Acquisition in Large-Scale Knowledge Bases</H1>

This is a summary of the participation of the
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/expect/expect-homepage.html">
EXPECT project </A>
at 
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/~gil">
USC/ISI 
</A>
in DARPA's new program on 
<A HREF="http://www.teknowledge.com/HPKB">
High-Performance Knowledge Bases </A>.

This work will build on the EXPECT architecture and 
extend it in three ways:


<UL>

<LI> EXCALIBUR: the next generation of the current EXPECT system, 
    our framework for developing KBSs that includes knowledge 
    acquisition tools.  EXCALIBUR will include an extended 
    language for problem-solving knowledge and an
    extended KBS compiler.


<LI> SHERPA: an acquisition mediator that will support knowledge 
     acquisition for KBSs not developed with our framework.  
     The mediator will have (possibly incomplete) models of 
     the KBS reasoning, and will use them to selectively route 
     updates to the knowledge library.

<LI> LIBRA: a framework for representing and managing a library 
    of problem-solving methods, including indexing tools, 
    composition tools, and selection tools.
