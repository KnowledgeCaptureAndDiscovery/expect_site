</P>

<P><B>Abstract:</B> 
Ontologies are becoming a recognized vehicle for knowledge reuse,
knowledge sharing, and modeling.  This paper presents PLANET, an
ontology for representing plans.  To show that PLANET is a comprehensive
ontology that can be <em>reused</em> to build new applications, we
describe several specializations of it to represent plans in three
different real-world domains that were made by adding minor extensions
to PLANET's general definitions and classes.  In past work, we have
developed several plan evaluation systems in these domains, and have
integrated them in several occasions with plan editors and plan
generation systems.  For each of these integrations, and often for each
system in the integration, a new format for exchanging plans was
devised.  PLANET can represent all of the plans that we and others have
used in these domains, providing a standard universal format for
knowledge <em>sharing</em> that can be used as an interlingua in
integrated planning applications.  Finally, the paper discusses how we
have used PLANET as a <em>knowledge modelling</em> tool to design
representations for courses of action in a military domain, guiding us
to make useful distinctions and modelling choices.

Capabilities Help in Planning?".

</P>

<P><B>Abstract:</B>
In order to support a wide range of planning-related activities, we
argue that plan and action representations must move to a more
expressive language for goals and capabilities than is found in most
current systems.  A structured representation for capabilities can make
explicit a hierarchy of capabilities based on subsumption, resulting in
benefits for reasoning, representing, and acquiring operators and
plans. By making capabilities more easily understandable to humans, such
a representation can also benefit mixed-initiative approaches. We
present a structured representation of capabilities and a
subsumption-based matcher for it. We then describe three existing
systems that use this approach in different kinds of planning tasks and
tools. We finish with a discussion of how plan generation systems can
benefit from using this representation.

<P><B>Abstract:</B> 
  In this paper, we use the example of a successful mixed-initiative
  plan evaluation tool for the domain of air campaign planning to argue
  that the human-in-the-loop is an important feature of enterprise
  control systems. Our tool, called INSPECT, evaluates air campaign
  plans and alerts the user about inconsistencies and potential
  problems. A generalization of INSPECT called PSMTool is also capable
  of limited interaction with a subject matter expert to capture new
  critiques of plans. The paper describes our work on INSPECT and
  PSMTool, analyzes the key contributions of these tools, and draws some
  conclusions about the role of mixed-initiative tools in enterprise
  control systems.

Evaluate Air Campaign Plans". Internal Project Report. (<A HREF="./inspect-paper.pdf">PDF file </A>) 
</P>

<P><B>Abstract:</B> INSPECT is a mixed-initiative plan evaluation tool in the domain of
   air campaign planning that has been a central component of several
   major DARPA demonstrations of integrated planning environments and
   tools. The creation process of an air campaign plan is manually
   driven at its higher levels, and because plans are complex and
   always changing they often (our experience says always) contain
   errors or inconsistencies.  INSPECT evaluates user-generated plans
   and alerts the user about inconsistencies and potential problems.
   INSPECT has received wide acceptance by air campaign planning
   experts, and is currently undergoing new extensions and further
   integrations with other tools in this domain. The paper describes
   our work on INSPECT, analyzes the key contributions of this tool,
   and draws some conclusions about the design and integration of
   planning applications.</P>

<B> Abstract: </B> 
EXPECT provides an environment for developing knowledge-based
systems that allows end-users to add new knowledge without needing
to understand the details of system organization and
implementation.  The key to EXPECT's approach is that it
understands the structure of the knowledge-based system being
built: how it solves problems and what knowledge it needs to
support problem-solving. EXPECT uses this information to guide
users in maintaining the knowledge-based system. We have used
EXPECT to develop a tool for evaluating transportation plans.

"On Analyzing Planning Applications".
<i>AAAI Fall Symposium on "Planning and Learning: 
On to Real Applications"</i>,

<P>

<B> Abstract: </B> 
It is hard to evaluate in current planning applications 
what aspects of the approach address each of the complexities of the problem.
This results from the fact that
the planning community is lacking a vocabulary to describe planning tasks 
and applications.
This work is an effort towards descriptions of planning applications 
in terms that are useful 1) to extract conclusions from particular implementations,
2) to facilitate cross-comparisons among different planners applied to the same problem,
and 3) to facilitate comparisons among different tasks.
We analyze the Sisyphus experience, a 3-year old and still 
ongoing effort in the knowledge acquisition community
to enable a cross-comparison of
their application systems as they implement a common pre-stated problem description.
Based on this experience, we propose a set of dimensions to describe applications that
distinghish between descriptions of the properties of the architecture, 
the type of problem, and the data sets.
We show how they can be used to
produce useful distictions in the context of the first Sisyphus task, 
which was an office assignment problem.
Our hope is that the same dimensions will be useful to other researchers
in describing and characterizing their applications, as well as a
useful point of comparison for future Sisyphus efforts.

<B> Abstract: </B> 
This document is the result of a joint effort to understand what are relevant
factors to consider when there are several possible courses of action (COAs)
to accomplish a Non-combatant Evacuation Operation (NEO) military mission.
These relevant factors are useful for generation and evaluation of COAs and
provide the basis for a good decision in selecting a COA.  The document
compiles the relevant factors from the perspective of logistics that are
useful to evaluate whether or not alternative proposed COAs can be supported
logistically, and which ones seem to be better alternatives compared to the
others.  The ultimate goal of this joint effort is to use these factors to
automate the evaluation and comparison of COAs and use the comparison to
determine what are critical aspects of a COA that may be changed to produce a
better option with a generative planner.  We discuss how we envision
using EXPECT and O-Plan2 for this purpose.

</P>
<P><B>Abstract:</B>
The recent advances in computer speed and algorithms for probabilistic
inference have led to a resurgence of work on planning under
uncertainty. The aim is to design AI planners for environments where
there may be incomplete or faulty information, where actions may not
always have the same results and where there may be tradeoffs between
the different possible outcomes of a plan.  Addressing uncertainty in AI
planning algorithms will greatly increase the range of potential
applications but there is plenty of work to be done before we see
practical decision-theoretic planning systems. This article outlines
some of the challenges that need to be overcome and surveys some of the
recent work in the area.
