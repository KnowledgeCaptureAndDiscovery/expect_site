   INSPECT is a mixed-initiative plan evaluation tool in the domain of
   air campaign planning that has been a central component of several
   major DARPA demonstrations of integrated planning environments and
   tools. The creation process of an air campaign plan is manually
   driven at its higher levels, and because plans are complex and
   always changing they often (our experience says always) contain
   errors or inconsistencies.  INSPECT evaluates user-generated plans
   and alerts the user about inconsistencies and potential problems.
   INSPECT has received wide acceptance by air campaign planning
   experts, and is currently undergoing new extensions and further
   integrations with other tools in this domain. The paper describes
   our work on INSPECT, analyzes the key contributions of this tool,
   and draws some conclusions about the design and integration of
   planning applications.
