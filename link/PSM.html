<P>As intelligent systems become larger and work in increasingly more complex
and knowledge intensive environments, it becomes impractical to develop
knowledge bases from scratch. A practical alternative is to develop
knowledge bases out of reusable components, either ontologies or
domain-independent problem solving
methods. We are developing a reusable knowledge base of general principles
about plan evaluation and critiquing.
It includes ontologies to represent plans and critiques, an ontology of
evaluation criteria, and problem-solving knowledge about how to evaluate
plans with respect to those criteria. Currently, the evaluation criteria
analyze various aspects of the plan structure and its use of resources. We
performed a study of three evaluation and critiquing task domains, and
found that our framework covers 96 percent of the critiquing criteria
related to plan structure and resource use. Our framework also enables a
systematic approach to the development of plan evaluation tools by
following the organization of the criteria in the method.</P>
