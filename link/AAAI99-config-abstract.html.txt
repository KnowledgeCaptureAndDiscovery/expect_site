</B></FONT><FONT FACE="TIMES" SIZE=1><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Configuration systems often use large and complex knowledge bases that need to be maintained and extended over time. The explicit representation of problem-solving knowledge and factual knowledge can greatly enhance the role of a knowledge acquisition tool by deriving from the current knowledge base, the knowledge gaps that must be resolved. This paper details EXPECTís approach to knowledge acquisition in the configuration domain using the propose-and-revise strategy as an example. EXPECT  supports users in a variety of KA tasks like filling knowledge roles, making modifications to the knowledge base including entering new components, classes and even adapting problem-solving strategies for new tasks. EXPECTís guidance changes as the knowledge base changes, providing a more flexible approach to knowledge acquisition. The paper also examines the possible use of EXPECT as a KA tool in the complex and real world domain of computer configuration. </P>
