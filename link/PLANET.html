<TD WIDTH=500>As we develop larger and more complex intelligent systems in
knowledge-intensive domains, it becomes impractical to develop knowledge
bases from scratch.  Recent research investigates how to develop
intelligent systems by drawing from libraries of reusable components that
include both ontologies and problem-solving methods.  Planet is a reusable
ontology for representing plans that is designed to accomodate a diverse
range of real-world plans, both manually and automatically created.  We
have drawn from our past experience in designing, developing and ntegrating
planning tools, and expect planet to ease these tasks in the future in
three ways.  First, we have already found it useful for knowledge
modelling. By providing a structure that formalizes useful distinctions
for reasoning about states and actions, a knowledge engineer can find the
semantics of informal expressions of plans (e.g., textual or
domain-specific) through designing mappings to the ontology.  Second, a
plan ontology can be a central vehicle for  knowledge reuse across
planning applications. Planet contains general, omain-independent
definitions that are common and useful across planning domains.  Third,
Planet should facilitate integration of planning tools through
knowledge sharing. </P>

<P> Currently, practical efforts to integrate planning
tools are done by designing separate interchange formats for (almost) each
pair of tools, since designing a more universal format is costly and often
more difficult than designing the entire set of pairwise formats. These
difficulties are in part because these systems include decision-support
tools such as plan editors, plan evaluation tools, and plan critiquers,
which represent plans in ways that are different from traditional AI plan
generation systems. An ontology like Planet can provide a shared plan
representation for systems to communicate and exhange information about the
plan, and can facilitate the creation of a common, overarching knowledge
base for future integrations of planning tools.</P>
