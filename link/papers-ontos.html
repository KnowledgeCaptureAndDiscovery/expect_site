<P><B>Abstract:</B> This paper describes an integrated acquisition
interface that includes several techniques previously developed to
support users in various ways as they add new knowledge to an
intelligent system.  As a result of this integration, the individual
techniques can take better advantage of the context in which they are
invoked and provide stronger guidance to users.  We describe the current
implementation using examples from a travel planning domain, and
demonstrate how users can add complex knowledge to the system.

<P><B>Abstract:</B> 
Ontologies are becoming a recognized vehicle for knowledge reuse,
knowledge sharing, and modeling.  This paper presents PLANET, an
ontology for representing plans.  To show that PLANET is a comprehensive
ontology that can be <em>reused</em> to build new applications, we
describe several specializations of it to represent plans in three
different real-world domains that were made by adding minor extensions
to PLANET's general definitions and classes.  In past work, we have
developed several plan evaluation systems in these domains, and have
integrated them in several occasions with plan editors and plan
generation systems.  For each of these integrations, and often for each
system in the integration, a new format for exchanging plans was
devised.  PLANET can represent all of the plans that we and others have
used in these domains, providing a standard universal format for
knowledge <em>sharing</em> that can be used as an interlingua in
integrated planning applications.  Finally, the paper discusses how we
have used PLANET as a <em>knowledge modelling</em> tool to design
representations for courses of action in a military domain, guiding us
to make useful distinctions and modelling choices.

<B>Abstract:</B>
As intelligent systems become larger and work in increasingly more
complex and knowledge intensive environments, it becomes impractical to
develop knowledge bases from scratch.  A practical alternative is to
develop knowledge bases out of reusable components, either ontologies or
domain-independent problem solving methods.  This paper describes a
reusable knowledge base of general principles about plan evaluation and
critiquing.  It includes ontologies to represent plans and critiques, an
ontology of evaluation criteria, and problem-solving knowledge about how
to evaluate plans with respect to those criteria.  Currently, the
evaluation criteria analyze various aspects of the plan structure and
its use of resources.  We performed a study of three evaluation and
critiquing task domains, and found that our framework covers
approximately 75 percent of the critiquing criteria related to plan
structure and resource use (and over 90 percent within the framework's
declared scope).  Our framework also enables a systematic approach to
the development of plan evaluation tools by following the organization
of the criteria in the method.

<B> Abstract: </B>
If we could share knowledge across systems, costs would be
reduced.  However, because knowledge bases are typically constructed from
scratch, each with their own idiosyncratic structure, sharing is difficult.
Recent research has focused on the use of ontologies to promote sharing. An
ontology is a hierarchically structured set of terms for describing a domain
that can be used as a skeletal foundation for a knowledge base.  If two
knowledge bases are built on a common ontology, knowledge can be more readily
shared, since they share a common underlying structure.  This paper outlines a
set of desiderata for ontologies, and then describes how we have used a
large-scale (50,000+ concept) ontology to develop a specialized,
domain-specific ontology semi-automatically.  We then discuss the relation
between ontologies and the process of developing a system, arguing that to be
useful, an ontology needs to be created as a "living document", whose
development is tightly integrated with the system's.  We conclude with a
discussion of Web-based ontology tools we are developing to support this
approach.<P>
