<P><B>Abstract:</B> This paper describes our analysis of the literature on tutorial dialogues and
presents a compilation of useful principles that students and teachers follow
in making tutoring interactions successful.  The compilation is done in the
context of making use of those principles in building interactive acquisition
interfaces since acquisition interfaces can be seen as students acquiring
knowledge from the user.  We plan to use these ideas in our future work to
develop more proactive and effective acquisition interfaces.

<B> Abstract: </B>
This paper argues that interactive knowledge acquisition tools would benefit
from a tighter and more thorough incorporation of tutoring and learning
principles.  Current systems learn from users in a very passive and disengaged
manner, and could be designed to incorporate the proactive capabilities that
one expects of a good student.  This paper points out what tutoring and
learning principles have been used to date in the acquisition literature,
though unintentionally and implicitly.  We discuss how a more thorough and
explicit representation of these principles would help improve enormously how
computers learn from users.

"Proactive Learning for Interactive Knowledge Capture".
<i>(draft)</i>

</P>

<P><B>Abstract:</B> Current tools for interactive knowledge capture have little or no learning
aptitude.  They are mostly oblivious to the process or strategy that the user
may be following in entering new knowledge, unaware of their progress during a
session, and ignorant of typical skills expected from a good student.  User
has to make up for these shortcomings by tracking the status, progress,
potential problems, and possible courses of action themselves.  We present an
approach to make acquisition interfaces more proactive by extending them with:
1) goals that represent what remains to be learned, 2) strategies to achieve
these goals and acquire further knowledge, and 3) awareness of the current status
of the body of knowledge learned.  The resulting interaction shows that the
system is aware of its progress towards acquiring the new knowledge, and moves
forward by understanding what acquisition goals and strategies to pursue.
