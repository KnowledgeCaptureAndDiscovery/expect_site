SUMMARY OF PLANS FOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT IN EXPECT

                    JULY 6, 2001
=================================================================================


* Status of software:
- Current working system is Constable-2001, it has:
     - client, which we'll call UberClient version 0.0 (UC 0.0)
     - server, which we'll call UberServer version 0.0 (US 0.0)
- Older versions of the software (same server as Constable-2001 (but 
older version of it!), client has additional functionality we want to 
use):
    - EMED'98
    - IUI-2001


* Overall plan:
- Muchta will revive and integrate client functionality of various 
versions of the software, email detailed requests to Norm pointing up 
what functions need to be fixed in the server
- Norm will maintain a server that Muchta can connect new versions of 
the clients to and test



WEEK OF JULY 9-13

clients will talk to
