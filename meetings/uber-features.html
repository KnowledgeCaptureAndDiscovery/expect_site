    <h1>Features to show in a unified interface</h1>

<P>
These are the features we mentioned on May 2nd, that we would want to be 
      showable in a demo. We're currently thinking about how these can
      fit with the travel planning scenario.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Interdependency model. This is a complex issue that we need to think
        about and break down into smaller parts. We mentioned the
        following:
        <ul>
	<li> An instance acquirer that uses the interdependency model
	  to ask for only the relevant roles of a new instance.</li>
	<li> Using the interdependency model to give help for adding
	  classes as the user mentions them while creating a
	  method.</li>
	<li> Interdependencies used in Expect have grown to include
	  those between methods and methods, between methods and the
	  concept KB, and between domain-independent and
	  domain-dependent knowledge. (Were there others? I didn't
	  take notes about this.)
	</ul>
        </li>
<li> Visualizing the state of KB development. This may include a slider
        that controls the version currently being viewed in a history of 
        modifications, which could be used to move through a demo
        efficiently.</li>
<li> Using the same language and tools for both domain-dependent and
        domain-independent methods. The user being able to modify both
        parts of a KBS and even to generalize some domain-dependent K by 
        adding new domain-independent methods. </li>
<li> Modularity of the KBS. Visualizing different modules. This is
        related to the last item.</li>
<li> Using subsumption to index goals and methods.</li>
<li> Showing a performance element, so that the acquired knowledge does
        stuff. In longer demos, show ability to compile the acquired K
        as part of this.</li>
<li> English-based editor. Not just as an acquisition tool for users
        that are not trained in Expect syntax, but also using the
        English translation as a debugging aid for a KBS.</li>
<li> The PSTree view. </li>
<li> Following scripts, and using an ontology to generate questions
        about new knowledge and to classify it.</li>
</ul>
