<H1>An Intelligent Tool to Evaluate Air Campaign Plans</H1>
</CENTER>


<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/~valente/inspect/inspect.html">
INSPECT</A> is a plan evaluation tool that was built using the 
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/expect/expect-homepage.html">
EXPECT
</A>
framework to develop knowledge-based systems.  INSPECT was initially
developed as part of the work that the EXPECT project is doing under
the <A HREF="http://arpi.isx.com/"> the DARPA/Rome Laboratory Planning
Initiative (ARPI)</A> to create tools that support the US military in
developing air campaigns.  
INSPECT is now being extended in several important dimensions under the <A
HREF="http://yorktown.dc.isx.com/iso/planning/jfacc.html"> DARPA JFACC
program</A>.  
<P>

INSPECT takes an air campaign plan that has been manually developed
and looks for possible problems that a user may have overlooked, such
as inconsistencies or unrealistic use of resources.  An important part
of the work on INSPECT was the development of <A
HREF="http://www.isi.edu/~valente/grammar/grammar.html"> structured
representations (or grammars)</A> for air campaign plans.  <P>

INSPECT was an integral <A
HREF="http://www.isi.edu/expect/inspect-newsletter.html"> part of two
important demonstrations</A>: ARPI's Fourth Integrated Feasibility
Demonstration (IFD-4) in June 1996 and the Jumpstart Demonstration of
the DARPA JFACC program in January 1997.  <P>

<H2> Ongoing Work on INSPECT</H2>

INSPECT is being extended in several important dimensions under the <A
HREF="http://yorktown.dc.isx.com/iso/planning/jfacc.html"> DARPA JFACC
program</A>.  Some of these extensions require basic R&D work on the
EXPECT framework on generating explanations and justifications for
INSPECT's recommendations, and on Web-based tools to support domain
experts to change INSPECT's knowledge base.  Other extensions will
widen the scope of INSPECT's evaluations to (i) include additional
types of objectives (such as force support (logistics) and force
enhancement (ISR - intelligence, Surveillance and reconaissance) and
(ii) to evaluate the plan from a more global perspective that would
include information about strategy and plan rationale.  <P><HR>
