<H1>                 EXPECT: </H1>
<H1>A Reflective Architecture for Knowledge Acquisition</H1>
</CENTER>

The goal of the EXPECT project is to provide flexible 
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/expect/papers/papers-expect.html">
tools for building and maintaining knowledge-base systems</A> 
that are accesible to end-users.
The key to this goal is EXPECT's reflective capabilities to 
analyze the contents of its knowledge bases 
and determine exactly what every piece of knowledge contributes to the
task domain. 
<P>


We have used EXPECT to build 
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/expect/inspect.html">
INSPECT</A>, a decision-support 
tool to evaluate air campaign plans.
As part of this work, we developed a 
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/~valente/grammar/grammar.html">
structured grammar </A>
to represent planning objectives and goals in this domain.
EXPECT has also been used in other domains, including 
transportation planning,
protein synthesis,
and configuration.
<P>

Research by EXPECT project members spans the areas of 
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/expect/papers/papers-planning.html">
planning</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/expect/papers/papers-ka.html">
knowledge acquisition</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/expect/papers/papers-ontos.html">
ontology modeling and construction</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/expect/papers/papers-ml.html">
machine learning</A>,
knowledge representation, and 
natural language generation.
<P>

New areas of work include extending the EXPECT architecture 
to work with 
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/expect/sherpa/sherpa-index.html">
large-scale, high-performance knowledge bases
</A>,
and to extend our work on air campaign 
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/expect/inspect.html">
planning</A>.
