Here is a break-down of some of the tasks to be completed in the
remainder of June:

Constable:

  source code control: Feng to update code in CVS repository
  conversions: Feng implementing conversions between units 
               Quamrul supporting this in the UI
  JTree: Quamrul is re-implementing the Constable form using a JTree
  

Veil:

  Sliders: Quamrul is making the sliders update candidate shades without
           calling the server
  Robustness: Feng and Quamrul are taking the visualization code and 
           checking which pieces can be moved to the Java UI client and
           which can be generalised within the server.
  If there is time: Looking at moving the LPP interaction entirely to
                    the java client,
                    Making the JSlider box drag-and-drop
                    Improving ability to select ranges and add new fields
