<A NAME=Scope><H2>What is SAXON?</H2></A>
The SAXON package is a Java interface for processing XML documents.<P>



It offers an alternative to both the raw SAX interface
(see <A HREF="http://www.microstar.com/xml/sax">www.microstar.com/xml/sax</A>)
and the full Document Object Model as defined by <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/dom">
W3C</A>.<P>

Like SAX, SAXON is an event-driven interface in which user-written code is
called when particular constructs are encountered in the source XML document.
If you are familiar with SAX, the main differences in SAXON are:<P>
<UL><LI>You can provide a separate handler for each element type, making
your application more modular
<LI>SAXON supplies context information to your application, so you
can find out, for example, the parent element of the one you are
currently processing
<LI>SAXON provides facilities for organizing the output of your application,
allowing you to associate different output streams (Java Writers) with
individual element instances or types.
<LI>SAXON provides a number of standard element handlers that you
can use to perform common rendition tasks. A SAXON application to produce HTML output
will often be much simpler than an equivalent XSL script, and SAXON
imposes fewer constraints.
<LI>SAXON allows you to register your preferred SAX-compliant XML parser;
you do not need to hard-code the name of the parser into your application
or supply it each time on the command line.
<LI>SAXON extends the SAX InputSource class allowing you to specify a
file name as the source of input. 
</UL>

An alternative way to process XML documents is to allow the XML parser to
create a tree structure - the Document Object Model or DOM - in memory, and 
then to navigate around this structure within your application. This is more
flexible than SAX, because processing does not need to be strictly serial, but
it can be difficult to write maintainable code to this interface. SAXON allows
you to process the DOM, or any part of it, in the same way as you process a raw
XML document, using exactly the same element handlers. This allows you to
easily adapt an existing application to take advantage of the DOM if required,
without a rewrite.<P>

<A NAME="Structure"><H2>Structure</H2></A>

SAXON is constructed as two distinct layers. You can use layer 1 on its own, which
provides the basic services, or you can use it in conjunction with layer 2, which provides
more specialised services.<P>

Layer 1, the <B>Distributor</B>, is responsible for registering and invoking
appropriate element handlers for each element type, and for providing the
element handler with contextual information about each element. It also
allows a Writer object to be registered for particular element types, so that
the input document can be split hierarchically. by channelling different parts
to different output destinations. This is useful both for splitting an input XML document into multiple XML
documents, and for creating HTML fragments that can be reassembled in a different
order for display<P>

Layer 2, the <B>Renderer</B>, provides a number of element handlers that
can be used to transform the XML information into a suitable output stream
(typically but not necessarily XML or HTML).<P>  


<A NAME=Distributor><H2>The Distributor</H2></A>

The core of SAXON is a program called the <A HREF="com.icl.saxon.Distributor.html">
<B>Distributor</B></A>. The reason for the name
is that it distributes events among a number of registered element handlers.
 (Another reason is that there already
seemed to be plenty of things around called "driver", "parser", "manager", 
"processor", or "handler", and I needed a new name).<P>

You can write an application either by sub-classing Distributor or by 
instantiating it and invoking its services directly.<P>

Running the Distributor is a several-stage process:<P>

<OL>
<LI>Instantiate it:<P> 
<CODE><I>Distributor d = new Distributor()</I></CODE><P>
The following steps can be done either from your calling program, or from
a constructor or initialisation method that you define within a subclass.<P>

<LI>Select the <B>Writers</B> for individual element types in your XML
document. A Writer is typically used for a major hierarchic subdivision of your XML document;
if you define the Writer for one element type, then all the elements subordinate
to it will use the same Writer, unless you define otherwise. The appropriate
Writer is used whenever your element handler uses the write() method to produce
output. You can achieve maximum flexibility by using a StringWriter.<P>

Note that the Writer is associated with element types, not instances: if you call:<P>

<CODE><I>d.setWriter("SCENE", sceneWriter);</I></CODE><P>

then all SCENE elements and their subordinate elements will be output using
the same sceneWriter object. An alternative, more flexible approach is to
define a separate writer for each element instance: you can do this by calling
<I>ElementInfo.setWriter()</I> from the <I>startElement()</I> method in
your element handler.<P>

If the element type does not identify the context uniquely, you can qualify
it with the parent element type. For example:<P>

<CODE>
<I>d.setWriter("ACT/TITLE", actWriter);</I><P></CODE>

This sets the context for the TITLE element whenever
it occurs immediately within an ACT element. (This PARENT/CHILD syntax
is used consistently throughout the SAXON API).<P>

<LI>Select the element handlers to be used for individual elements
of your XML document. See the following section for how to write an 
element handler.<P>

<CODE>
<I>d.setHandler( "SCENE", new SCENEHandler() );</I><BR>
<I>d.setHandler( "ACT/TITLE", new ACTTITLEHandler() );</I><P>
</CODE>

Again you can use the PARENT/CHILD syntax.<P>

 You can define several
handlers for the same element type: they are invoked "outwards-in". That is,
the first handler registered is called before the second in the case of
the startGroup(), startElement(), characters(), and ignorable() interfaces;
the first handler is called after the second in the case of endElement() and
endGroup(). Note however that if there there is a handler for ACT/TITLE and
another for TITLE, the handler for TITLE will never be called to process a
TITLE that appears immediately within an ACT.<P>

If you supply no element handler for a particular element type, the Distributor uses a null
handler that does nothing (but it still processes its children).<P>

<LI>Run the Distributor, supplying an input XML file.<P>
<CODE><I>d.run(new ExtendedInputSource(new File(filename)))</I></CODE><P>
The parameter to run() is an InputSource, as defined in the SAX
interface. Because using a file as input is common, SAXON provides 
for convenience the class ExtendedInputSource which allows a File
to be supplied as the input source.<P>

</OL><P>

<A NAME=Renderer><H2>The Renderer</H2></A>

The SAXON <A HREF="com.icl.saxon.Renderer.html">Renderer</A> class
 specialises the Distributor for applications that
involve transformation of an XML input document into (typically) XML
or HTML output documents.<P>

The main purpose of Renderer is to provide a number of standard element
handlers, and a simple way of invoking them using simple parameters.
 The relevant interfaces are:<P>

    <TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
    <A HREF="com.icl.saxon.Renderer.html#setItemRendition">setItemRendition</A></TD><TD>
    This invokes the standard element handler <A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ItemRenderer.html">
    ItemRenderer</A> which outputs the character content
    of the element, preceded and followed by user-supplied strings. These strings
    can also include parameterised insertion points to insert the values of
    attributes.</TD></TR>
    <TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
    <A HREF="com.icl.saxon.Renderer.html#setGroupRendition">setGroupRendition</A></TD><TD>
    This invokes the standard element handler <A HREF="com.icl.saxon.GroupRenderer.html">
    GroupRenderer</A> which processes a group of one or
    more consecutive elements of the same type. It outputs the character content
    of the elements unchanged, and also outputs user-specified strings before
    the first element of the group, between consecutive elements of the group,
    and after the last element of the group.
    </TD></TR>
    <TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
    <A HREF="com.icl.saxon.Renderer.html#setNumbering">setNumbering</TD><TD>
    This invokes the standard element handler <A HREF="com.icl.saxon.NumberHandler.html">
    NumberHandler</A> which generates consecutive numbers for elements
    subordinate to a given hierarchic level. The numbers are generated as pseudo-attributes
    which can be accessed and output in the same way as any other attribute of an element.
    </TD></TR>
    <TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
    <A HREF="com.icl.saxon.Renderer.html#setSorter">setSorter</TD><TD>
    This invokes the standard element handler <A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementSorter.html">
    ElementSorter</A> which allows a group of consecutive elements of the same type
    to be sorted on the value of any attribute, or on the content, or on a calculated
    attribute (which might, for example, be the value of a nested child element).
    </TD></TR></TABLE>Of course you can also supply your own element handlers,
     as with the Distributor.<P>


The Renderer also provides a number of useful rendition services, for example the ability to
"escape" character data by replacing special characters such as &lt; with their
XML/HTML expansions such as &amp;lt;.<P>

Unlike the Distributor, the default element handler used by the Renderer
is <A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementCopier.html">ElementCopier</A>. This
element handler copies the XML input to the appropriate output writer.<P>


<A NAME=ElementHandler><H2>Writing an Element Handler</H2></A>

User-written element-handlers should be written to implement the
interface <A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementHandler.html">
ElementHandler</A>. Optionally, you can define them as subclasses of the
system-supplied class <A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementHandlerBase.html">
ElementHandlerBase</A>, an element handler that does nothing. Or you
 can define them as subclasses of the
system-supplied class <A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementCopier.html">
ElementCopier</A>, an element handler that copies the element (tags,
attributes, and immediate character content - but not of course child
elements) to the appropriate output writer.<P>

If you write your element handler by subclassing one of these
supplied element handlers, then you only need to provide those
methods that perform a different action from the default.<P>

Normally you will write one element handler for each type of element,
but it is quite possible to use the same handler for several
different elements. You can also write completely general-purpose
handlers: the system-supplied NumberHandler which performs automatic
section numbering is an example.<P>

You provide one method for each event associated with the selected
element type. The events available are:<P>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=150>
<A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementHandler.html#beforeGroup">beforeGroup()</A></TD>
<TD>This is called immediately before a group
of one or more elements of the same type appearing in sequence. To
put it another way, it is called before every element that is not
preceded by another of the same type. This event can be very useful
when generating table structures for output. (Note, unlike the similar
construct in XSL, this event occurs even for a "group" of one element,
and it does not inhibit the startElement() event).</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementHandler.html#startElement">startElement()</A>
</TD><TD>This is called when the start of the element
is encountered. The ElementInfo object passed gives you information about
the element and it attributes. It also gives you access to the Context object
appropriate to your context in the XML source.
You can store information in the ElementInfo object
if you wish, using one of two techniques:

    <UL>
    <LI>The setExtendedAttribute() interface allows you to store a keyword=value
    pair as if it were an attribute encountered in the XML source. You can set the
    attribute either on the current element, or on another element such as the parent
    element. This technique is useful
    if you want to supply a default value that was omitted in the source; but the
    mechanism is completely general, and you can invent new attributes and even new
    element types if you wish. 
    <LI>The setUserData() interface allows you to store an arbitrary object in the
    ElementInfo object. This is useful if you are building up an object model from
    the XML document, and you want to link XML elements to objects in your model.
    It also allows you to perform simple functions such as counting the length of
    character data encountered within an element.
    </UL>
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementHandler.html#characters">characters()</A>
</TD><TD>This is called when character data is
encountered within the context of this element type. You have access 
to the same ElementInfo structure as is used for the start and end of the element.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementHandler.html#ignorable">ignorable()</A>
</TD><TD>This is called when "ignorable white space" is
encountered within the context of this element type. </TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementHandler.html#endElement">endElement()</A>
</TD><TD>This is called when the end of the element is
encountered. You have access to the same ElementInfo structure as was used for the start
of the corresponding element.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementHandler.html#afterGroup">afterGroup()</A>
</TD><TD>This is called at the end of a sequence of one or
more elements of the same type. More strictly, it is called when the group
is known to have ended: that is, before processing the first element at the
same level of a different type, or the end tag of the parent element. For
example, the event occurs for element P at the point marked * in the following
sequences:<BR>
<PRE>
    &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;(text)&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;(text)*&lt;Q&gt;&lt;/Q&gt;
    &lt;K&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;(text)&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;(text)*&lt;/K&gt;
</PRE>

</TD></TR></TABLE>


<A NAME=ElementInfo><H2>The ElementInfo Object</H2></A>

The ElementInfo object represents an element of the XML document (that is,
a structure with a start and end tag)<P>

The main purpose of the ElementInfo object is to provide element handlers
with information about the context in which they are called. The methods
available include:<P>

<TABLE><TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=150>
<A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementInfo.html#getTag">getTag()</A></TD>
<TD>get the tag of the element, as a String</TD></TR>



<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementInfo.html#getAttributeList">getAttributeList()</A></TD>
<TD>get the values of all the attributes of this element, 
as a SAX AttributeList object. </TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementInfo.html#getAttribute">getAttribute()</A></TD>
<TD>get the value of a specified attribute, as a String. </TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementInfo.html#getExtendedAttribute">getExtendedAttribute()</A></TD>
<TD>get the value of a specified attribute, as a String. This can
retrieve either an attribute on the current element, or the most-recently
encountered attribute on a different element: use the syntax
"element-name/attribute-name". This might be an attribute actually present
in the source document, or an attribute created dynamically using the
setExtendedAttribute() interface.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementInfo.html#getParent">getParent()</A></TD>
<TD>get the ElementInfo of the parent element. Note that if you frequently
need to take different action depending on the parent element type,
it may be better to provide separate handlers for the element depending
on the context it appears in.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementInfo.html#getAncestor">getAncestor()</A></TD>
<TD>get the nearest ancestor with a specified tag. This is often useful
for locating the root element.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementInfo.html#getPreviousSibling">getPreviousSibling()</A></TD>
<TD>get the ElementInfo for the previous element at the same
level. (Note that you can navigate to your ancestors or to your older siblings, or to
the older siblings of your ancestors. You cannot look forwards in the document, or
navigate to your children, or to the children of any element that has already ended.
 If you need to do this, use the DOM.)</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementInfo.html#setuserData">setUserData()</A>,<BR>
<A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementInfo.html#getUserData">getUserData()</A></TD>
<TD>These methods allow you to save information
in your startElement() handler which will be available later in other handlers such
as endElement(), and also when processing character data or child elements occurring
within this element</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementInfo.html#isFirstOfType">isFirstOfType()</A></TD>
<TD>True if the element is the first of a group of one or
more consecutive elements of the same type at the same level. Since 
a single element counts as a group, this returns false only if the element
is immediately preceded by another element of the same type at the same level.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementInfo.html#isFirstChild">isFirstChild()</A></TD>
<TD>True if the element is the first child element of its parent</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementInfo.html#hasParent">hasParent()</TD>
<TD>True if the parent element has the tag specified as a parameter. This is a
convenience method, the same effect can be achieved using 
getParent().getTag().equals(tag)</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementInfo.html#setExtendedAttribute">
setExtendedAttribute()</A></TD>
<TD>As an alternative to setUserData(), this allows you to save
information associated with the element for later use. The information can be retrieved
later using getExtendedAttribute() exactly as if it were present in the original XML source. The
special attribute named "#" is set in this way if you invoke the NumberHandler on the
element; the "#" attribute contains the generated section number.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementInfo.html#getHandler">
getHandler()</A></TD>
<TD>This returns the handler for the element in question. This is useful
because you can navigate from the current element to other elements such as
an ancestor; calling getHandler() on the ElementInfo for the Ancestor
element can give access to methods associated with that element type, 
for example a method that understands the attributes on that element.
(Remember that your element handler can provide methods additional to
those defined in the ElementHandler interface.)</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<A HREF="com.icl.saxon.ElementInfo.html#getElementInDOM">
getElementInDOM()</A></TD>
<TD>This method can only be used if you have chosen to build the
Document Object Model (DOM) by calling 
<A HREF="com.icl.saxon.Distributor.html#setOption">setOption()</A> to set the
BUILD_DOM option. If you did this, getElementInDOM() will return the
Element object for the current element, as defined in the DOM specification.
You can use this in any way permitted by the DOM, for example you can
add additional child elements to this element.</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<A NAME="DOM"><H2>Using SAXON with the Document Object Model</H2></A>

If the BUILD_DOM option to Distributor is set to true (using the 
<A HREF="com.icl.saxon.Distributor.html#setOption">setOption()</A> interface)
then SAXON will operate in two passes. The first pass will
build the Document Object Model in memory, and the second pass will
perform a depth-first traversal of the DOM tree structure, calling
SAXON element handlers as it does so.<P>

Using this option is slower, but it gives the application added flexibility.
For example: <UL>

<LI>After processing the entire tree once, you can process individual nodes
of the tree again, perhaps with different element handlers. 

<LI>The ElementInfo structure passed to element handlers includes a pointer
to the relevant node of the DOM tree. You can use this to perform navigation
that would not be possible using SAXON alone, for example finding an element
by the value of its attributes. Having done this, you can create a new instance
of Distributor and use it to process another branch of the DOM tree.

<LI>You can modify the DOM tree and then use SAXON to navigate the modified DOM.
There is also a function to save the current state of the DOM tree as an
XML document: this is implemented simply by doing a complete walk of the
tree with the standard SAXON ElementCopier as the element handler.

</UL>
[A word of warning: this aspect of SAXON is relatively new and untested.]<P>

To build the DOM, SAXON uses the FREE-DOM package (available from www.docuverse.com )
SAXON includes a driver, DOMDriver, which behaves as a SAX-compliant parser but
builds the FREE-DOM tree and uses this, rather than the raw XML document, as
its input.<P>

<A NAME="XRenderer"><H2>The XRenderer Interface</H2></A>

The class <A HREF="com.icl.saxon.XRenderer.html">XRenderer</A> is designed to
provide a simple interface to SAXON's capabilities for use from ActiveX
environments such as Active Server Pages. This is achieved by registering
XRenderer as an ActiveX object using Microsoft's javareg tool. To make
XRenderer easy to use from such environments, all its methods take simple 
character strings and integers (and not objects) as parameters.<P>
