<A NAME=Scope><H2>What is SAXON?</H2></A>
The SAXON package is a Java interface for processing XML documents.
It provides a set of services that are particularly useful for 
applications performing XML->XML or XML->HTML transformations.<P>

SAXON is designed to help you write applications to process <I>a
specific document type</I>. If you want to write general-purpose
XML applications such as editors, you can still use it, but the benefits are
not as great.<P>

SAXON allows you to write your own element handlers or to use
standard element handlers supplied with SAXON. Each type of element
can have its own element handler, enabling you to keep your
application modular. The standard element handlers provide the
following services:<UL>
<LI>Copying an element unchanged to the output
<LI>Skipping over an element, omitting it from the output
<LI>Supplying strings to replace the start and end tags of an
element (for example to add HTML formatting)
<LI>Recognising a group of consecutive elements of the same type
(for example to generate an HTML table or list structure)
<LI>Sorting a group of consecutive elements of the same type
</UL>

When an element handler is invoked, it is provided with a range
of information and processing services via an 
<B>ElementInfo</B> object. These services include facilities to:<UL>
<LI>determine the element's type and attributes
<LI>locate the element's parent or elder siblings
<LI>set an output destination for output from this
element or its children (useful when splitting an XML document
heirarchically)
<LI>write output to this destination
<LI>associate user data with an element
</UL>

There is an option in SAXON to build the document tree (the DOM) in memory.
If you do this, the application can process the data in exactly the same
way as during a direct serial parse, but there is additional flexibility:
<UL>
<LI>You can process any part of the document you choose, any number of times,
with different element handlers if you wish; you are no longer constrained
to serial processing
<LI>You can modify the document in memory and save it back to disk as an
XML file.
</UL>

Although you could do this directly using the DOM, without help from SAXON,
using SAXON makes the navigation easier and allows the same code to be used
in a direct event-driven parse and in a DOM-based application.<P>


<A NAME=Background><H2>Background</H2></A>

I wrote SAXON to support an internal project in 
<A HREF="http://www.icl.com">ICL</A>. After writing
several XML applications using SAX, MSXML, and other interfaces,
I found I was writing repetitive code, and decided to package this
code in a reusable way. It gradually grew, became lopsided, and
as I had to revisit it to make it work with the final SAX interface,
I restructured a great deal of it to make it as general as possible.<P>

XSL was an influence on SAXON, both positive and negative. I tried
to use early XSL implementations and found them (a) very hard to use,
and (b) very limited in capability. But I found some useful concepts
in the XSL specifications and tried to incorporate corresponding
facilities into SAXON.<P>

My main aim was to reduce the time it takes to write an application. I have found I can
usually achieve a first-cut HTML rendition of a new XML document type
in about 50 lines of new code, and have it working in half a day.<P>

The name SAXON was chosen because it is a layer on top of SAX. Also,
I was using Ælfred at the time; Ælfred of course is a Saxon king...<P>

<A NAME=Conditions><H2>Conditions of Use</H2></A>

ICL currently has no plans to turn SAXON into a general release product. At
present its specification has certain limitations (for example the
exception handling is very poor, and it has no support for the obscurer parts
of XML such as processing instructions and notations). More importantly,
SAXON has not been validated with any kind of thoroughness.<P>

The software is therefore offered <I>as is</I>, with no warranty,
support, guarantee, or implication that it is fit for any purpose.
There is no implication that it will be maintained in the future.
Using it may damage your health and your wealth, though it can
only improve your wisdom.<P>

With this proviso, feel free to use the software as you see fit,
but do not include it in a commercial product.
Distribute it onwards if you wish, provided you include
 this document in full.<P>

ICL retains the copyright, and therefore all rights to commercial
exploitation in the future.<P>

<A NAME=Distribution><H2>Distribution</H2></A>

The SAXON software is available for download as a java package. 
The package name is com.icl.saxon; install it on your classpath.
The central classes are available in object form only, but 
add-on classes such as element handlers and example applications
are available in source.<P>

User documentation is included in the form of <A HREF="packages.html">javadoc specifications</A>
together with an <A HREF="API_users_guide.html">API User's Guide</A>.<P>

The distribution includes a number of 
<A HREF="samples.html">example applications</A>.<P>

I have also used SAXON to develop <A HREF="home.iclweb.com/icl2/mhkay/GedML.html">GedML</A>,
 a suite of applications for processing genealogical data in XML. Source code
is available in the download.<P>

<B>Prerequisites</B>:<UL>
<LI>an XML parser with a SAX-compliant interface. See <A HREF="http://www.sil.org/sgml/xml.html">
http://www.sil.org/sgml/xml.html</A> for available products. SAXON has been tested
with AElfred, Lark, MSXML, xml4j, and xp.

<LI>a Java (JDK 1.1) development environment. SAXON has been tested with both
SUN's and Microsoft's Java compilers and VMs.
</UL>
