<H1>SAXON: What's New</H1>

<H2>Changes from 1998-05-12 to 1998-06-16</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Performance improvements (SAXON is now a factor of 2-to-3 faster)
<LI>added variant write() and writeEscape() methods to ElementInfo
<LI>added exception handling. Element handlers now have to catch/throw SAXException
<LI>setErrorOutput() method in Distributor to collect diagnostics
<LI>Renderer main program outputs elapsed time in milliseconds
<LI>new interface setOption(); maintenance of character content as a pseudo-attribute
<LI>is now optional (off by default); keeping a copy of attributes beyond startElement()
  is also optional.
<LI>can now work in conjunction with FREEDOM. This builds the DOM, then does a depth
  first walk of the tree calling the application element handlers as usual, but with
  a reference to the underlying Element object in the DOM model
<LI>minor bug fix:package name in sample ShowBooks program
</UL>

Future enhancements under consideration:<UL>
<LI>withdraw freestanding escape() and format() methods?
<LI>sort out getAttribute() versus getExtendedAttribute() interfaces
<LI>map new options to command-line switches in Renderer
<LI>switch to control output of performance info
<LI>named parsers in ParserManager
<LI>detect use of parameters in setItemRenderer and swicth attribute retention on 
  as necessary.
</UL>
