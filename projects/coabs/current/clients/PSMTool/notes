Still need to get highlighting to work for script stages

Need some indication of where we are in the script.

Make carriage return do something in questions.

Fix a button width so they don't have variable widths.

Make stub for max value work.

Make set of alts in method editor scroll to top.

Cut out variable name in var alts in M.E.

Make the alts print better. Maybe table form, maybe something else.

Add the final "check critique" button.

Go back to TK version and add whatever nicer features are missing.
