<P>The goal of this work is to develop a language, called CommonP, to represent Air Campaign Plans that will support the needs of DARPA&#146;s Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) program. This work represents the needs and recommendations of the technology-base projects in the JFACC program. It draws on our previous experience on AI planning and problem solving, knowledge representation and knowledge modeling, and knowledge sharing. </P>
<P>Within the JFACC program, the technologies that we are drawing from are:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The ACT formalism for representing plan templates [Wilkins and Myers 95], which is the basis of SRI&#146;s contract on Continuous Planning and Execution. Karen Myers is the Principal Investigator. </LI>
<LI>EXPECT&#146;s language for representing goals and tasks [Swartout and Gil 95], which is a component of the EXPECT framework used in the INSPECT plan evaluation contract from USC/ISI and was the basis for the ACP objective representations used in the ARPI and JFACC programs. Yolanda Gil and Bill Swartout are Co-Principal Investigators. </LI>
<LI>LOOM&#146;s knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities [MacGregor 94], which is a knowledge representation system at the core of the JFACC ontologies contract from USC/ISI. Bob MacGregor is Principal Investigator. </LI>
<LI>The OPIS modeling language for resources and temporal constraints [Smith 93], which is used in CMU&#146;s mixed-initiative scheduling contract for JFACC. Steve Smith and Steve Roth are Co-Principal Investigators.</LI></UL>

<P>Our approach to developing CommonP is to put together an initial version of the language that combines useful ideas from the above sources as we find them appropriate to support the JFACC program goals. We will test it by representing actual air campaign plans used in JFACC demonstration scenarios and by having our systems reason with those representations. Based on the lessons learned from this test, we will extend the representation and iterate this process.</P>
<P>This effort is related to other efforts in designing common plan representations, but is more focused and specific to the needs of the JFACC program. While we intent to align CommonP with these efforts, our work is a smaller scale and more specific effort that will not need to address some of the hard planning issues that are not specific to this domain and that will be considered by these other groups. Our effort is empirical and practical in nature. CommonP will be extended and updated as we understand through experience its adequacy to meet the needs of the JFACC program. We will also be responsive to progress in common plan representations from DARPA and from the planning community at large, extending CommonP accordingly as long as it fills a need within the scope of the JFACC program goals. As an empirical piece of work, it should serve as a useful point of reference for these other efforts regarding the representational needs of our specific domain.</P>

<P>CommonP is work in progress. Comments and requests for updates should be sent to the authors.</P>
