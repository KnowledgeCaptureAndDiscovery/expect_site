   THESEUS AGENT SPECS FOR "MEET THE ELVES" PHOSPHORUS PORTAL


====================================================================
THESEUS AGENT INPUTS:

Each agent has a list of inputs, each input is specified within an XML tag.
The order of the inputs does not matter. Some inputs may be empty,
but the tag has to be included in the messages.  No spaces should appear
within the tags.  Tag names are case sensitive.

All the input parameters are surrounded by a tag "OBJECT" (it is tradition to
use this tag in the wrapper work).


====================================================================
USERS:

Users will be identified by their email address, which the Teamcore agents
will translate into the whole names.

====================================================================

OTHER:

   - messages should include when possible a pointer to ontology/schema files

====================================================================

INPUT PARAMETER SPECS FOR ALL THESEUS AGENTS

The following constraints are applicable to all Theseus agents used in this integration:

   airline: a string (the airline name).  Must be one of a prespecified set.
   flight: a number
   date: MM/DD/YYYY.  No preceeding zeroes are allowed, so if a number is less than ten it will
              be single digit.
   airport: a string that corresponds to the airport code.  It must be 3 letters long.
   email: the user unique id as his/her email address
   fax: fax numbers must be 9 digits, and should not contain parentheses or dashes.
   time:  one or two digits for the hour, followed by a semicolon, followed by two digits
              for the minutes, followed by a space, followed by "am" or "pm".


====================================================================

REPLIES FROM THE AGENTS

The agent will send a reply that includes the request and a message for the user.
Teamcore agents will receive the same messages and will be responsible for
notifying the user in an appropriate manner and device.

The agent may send more than one reply to a given request, one for each time the
flight is delayed or cancelled by the airline.

An agent will send no reply if there are no changes.


====================================================================

ERRORS AND LACK OF REPLIES FROM THE AGENTS

Users may make errors when they specify the arguments.
Some errors will be detected in the interface, since each
input parameter will be described in a schema/ontology
and this information will be used to check the parameters.
For example, the interface will check that the airport
is specified as a string that is 3 characters long.

Other errors cannot be checked by the interface in practice.  For
example, the flight number needs to be validated depending
on the airline and date.  The agents may be able to detect
some of these errors and report them back in a message
(the format of these messages is shown below).

Other errors may not be detected by an agent, and in those cases
the agent will send no replies.

Notice that if a user does not receive a reply to a given request
there is no way to know whether there was no change to the flights or
there were errors in the inputs specified by the user.
