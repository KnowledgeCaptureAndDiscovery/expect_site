   THESEUS AGENT SPECS FOR "MEET THE ELVES" PHOSPHORUS PORTAL

                       Version 0.5  (12/13/01)
====================================================================


NOTES:

* Incorporated in version 0.5:
 One problem in the spec of version 0.4 was that if the agent sent no
 messages back it was not clear if this should be interpreted as 
 nothing changed or as a sign that there were errors in the 
 inputs specified by the user.  In this version, we added three more 
 types of messages.  One is a message that the agent sends acknowledging
 receipt of the request.  The second is a message when the monitoring 
 agent has no changes to report, and it just says that everything 
 remains the same with the flight.  The third is a message 
 that reports an error in case the agent cannot answer the query 
 (e.g. server that the agent is accessing goes down).

* Incorporated in version 0.3:
 One problem in version 0.2 was that the messages did not use 
 appropriate KQML conventions.  In the new version, we use
 the conventional KQML performatives for replies and errors.
 We also use the conventional KQML fields to identify which
 request a reply is for (:reply-with and :in-reply-to).
 
* Incorporated in version 0.2:
 Version 0.1 did not have all the input parameters that the
 agent requires (eg, the user id). In the new version, we added
 a complete parameter set.      

====================================================================
THESEUS AGENT INPUTS:

Each agent has a list of inputs, each input is specified within an XML tag.
The order of the inputs does not matter. Some inputs may be empty,
but the tag has to be included in the messages.  No spaces should appear
within the tags.  Tag names are case sensitive.

All the input parameters are surrounded by a tag "OBJECT" (it is tradition to
use this tag in the wrapper work).

====================================================================
USERS:

Users will be identified by their email address, which the Teamcore agents
will translate into the whole names.

====================================================================

INPUT PARAMETER SPECS FOR ALL THESEUS AGENTS

The following constraints are applicable to all Theseus agents used in this integration:

  - airline: a string (the airline name).  Must be one of a prespecified set.
  - flight: a number
  - date: MM/DD/YYYY.  No preceeding zeroes are allowed, so if a number is less than ten it will
              be single digit.
  - airport: a string that corresponds to the airport code.  It must be 3 letters long.
  - email: the user unique id as his/her email address
  - fax: fax numbers must be 9 digits, and should not contain parentheses or dashes.
  - time:  one or two digits for the hour, followed by a semicolon, followed by two digits
              for the minutes, followed by a space, followed by "am" or "pm".
  - cost: a number (dollars).


====================================================================

REPLIES FROM THE AGENTS

The agent will send a reply that includes the request and a message for the user.
Teamcore agents will receive the same messages and will be responsible for
notifying the user in an appropriate manner and device.

The agent may send more than one reply to a given request. When the request 
is received, the agent will send a message to acknowledge receipt.  The
agent will send a reply message each time the flight is delayed or cancelled 
by the airline.  If there are no changes, an agent will send a reply hours 
before the flight to confirm to the user that there were no changes while 
it monitored the flight.

====================================================================

ERRORS REPORTS

Users may make errors when they specify the arguments.
Some errors will be detected in the interface, since each
input parameter will be described in a schema/ontology
and this information will be used to check the parameters.
For example, the interface will check that the airport
is specified as a string that is 3 characters long.

Other errors cannot be checked by the interface in practice.  For
example, the flight number needs to be validated depending
on the airline and date.  The agents may be able to detect
some of these errors and report them back in an error message
(the format of these messages is shown below).

Other errors may not be detected by an agent, and in those cases
the agent will send no replies.

====================================================================

SAMPLE MESSAGES

Below are examples of the messages that the Phosphorus Portal 
exchanges with the flight-status Theseus agent.  The formats are 
similar for other agents.

Sample request message:

   :reply-with "<OBJECT><airline>United
