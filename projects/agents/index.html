The main goal of this effort is to investigate how ontologies help in
agent coordination and communication.  
There are two related projects:

<LI> <A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/expect/projects/agents/phosphorus.html">
<b>Phosphorus:</b> a knowledge and experience-based capabilities matcher
</A>,
funded under the DARPA 
<A HREF="http://coabs.globalinfotek.com">
CoABS
</A>
program.
This work addresses the issue of 
how to match requests and agent capabilities through ontologies.  
The hypothesis is that a broad and shallow ontology (such as 
the HPKB upper ontology or SENSUS)
is sufficient for locating agents.

<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/expect/projects/agents/rosetta.html">
<b>Rosetta:</b> ontology-based agent communication
</A>,
funded by DARPA as an ISO Technology Integration Experiment 
between the 
<A HREF="http://www.teknowledge.com/HPKB">
HPKB
</A> 
and the 
<A HREF="http://coabs.globalinfotek.com">
CoABS
</A>
programs.
Once you have found agents 
with the right capability (for example through Phosporus), 
then they need to use
richer ontologies for communicating with each other.  
For this work, we will be using ontologies and tools
that we are developing under the HPKB program.
