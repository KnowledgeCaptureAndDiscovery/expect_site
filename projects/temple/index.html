    <h1>ISI TEMPLE Active Templates project</h1>

<P>
<EM>From the program approval document: </EM>
The Active Templates program (AcT) will produce a robust, lightweight
software technology for aiding in the automation of detailed planning
and execution for military operations and other highly-coordinated
activities using a plan spreadsheet metaphor. Active Templates are
distributed data structures whose variables will be linked to live data
feeds or problem-solving methods. Active Templates will assist with
automated planning and execution by capturing, improving and updating
critical information such as current state, goals, constraints,
alternative actions, standard defaults, problem-solving context over
time, decisions, and rationale. Active Templates will be designed to be
user-tailorable, networked, noise-tolerant, user-supported, scalable and
widely adopted.
</P>

<P>
Within AcT, the TEMPLE project is developing software tools to aid a
user in adding new constraints to active templates. This work makes use
of prior work on problem-solving methods and script-based acquisition
for plan evaluation performed under HPKB and ARPI.

language for sharing constraints between Active Templates tools (pdf
