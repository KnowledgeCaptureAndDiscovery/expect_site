	<b>Event:</b> Frances' Birth<br><br>
	<b>When:</b> October 1914
	<p><b>Supported by:</b>
	<ul><li type="1">Frances' insists she was born October 1914. [Guess we need a link to some document that contains this assertion]</li></ul></p>
	<p><b>DISMISS</b> because: At the time Sam left, he did not know Frances was expected.
		Frances' recollection would place his departure in March 1914, which is too early. By <a href="http://www.machtey.com/sylviatape2.htm">Sylvia's account</a>, he left
		some 6 to 9 months after a disastrous harvest in the spring 1914 
		and in <a href="http://www.marcuscorp.com/history.html">Ben's account</a>, he left in August 1914.</p>
