	<b>Event:</b> Stolpce Fire<br><br>
	<b>When:</b> September 1915
	<p><b>Supported by:</b>
	<ul><li type="1"></li><a href="http://www.naval-history.net/WW1AreaBaltic1914.htm">History of the Baltic 1914</a></ul></p>
	<p><b>DISMISS</b> because: Although it is conceivable that the Germans burned down the town in 
	September on their way through Belarus in the same month, this conflicts with the <a href="http://www.machtey.com">Yizkor book</a>, which
	states that the fire occurred in July. [The Yizkor book is very credible.]<p></p>
