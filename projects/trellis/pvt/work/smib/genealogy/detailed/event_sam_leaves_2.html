<body>
	<b>Event:</b> Samuel Machtey leaves Stolpce for America<br><br>
	<b>When:</b> March 1915
	<p><b>Supported by:</b>
	<ul><li type="1"><a href="http://www.machtey.com/sylviatape2.htm">Sylvia Interview</a></li></ul></p>
	<p><b>DISMISS:</b> because she is inconsistent within the same interview. She says Sam did not
	know that Dina was pregnant when he left and that Frances was an infant at the time of the fire, 
	the combination of which is unlikely.<p></p>
