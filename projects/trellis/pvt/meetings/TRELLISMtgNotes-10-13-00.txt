USER ACTIVITIES

in order to design our system, we should think about the user.
what kinds of things users would want to do with TRELLIS.

1) in order to create new information elements: 

 - user would specify a PURPOSE
 - search web resources for info relevant to that purpose
 - select a subset of those links as relevant
 - annotate/create a new piece of information
     with our creation tool.
   
the screen may look something like:
   ------------------------------
   purpose: ____           |
                           |   DEDIDE < >
   search: _____           |
                           |     BECAUSE < >
                           |    
    < search results >     |     DISMISS < >
                           |
                           |
                           |
     
search results may be prioritized/organized.  user may annotate them 
with thungs like "dismiss", "deemphasize", "low priority".


note that the same piece of information can be found very relevant to 
some purpose and completely irrelevant to another purpose.

2) another kind of activity that users would do is search and browse 
through the SMIB.


RESEARCH TOPICS

several research areas:

- design a canonical set of interdependency links
- reasoning/logic behind interdependency links to
   help users further through search and deduction
- integration with domain ontologies, i.e.,
   domain-specific interdependencies (x is ancestor of y)
- search and browse: what does this look like in an annotation 
   space
- user interaction: how can we make this tool accesible to end users
