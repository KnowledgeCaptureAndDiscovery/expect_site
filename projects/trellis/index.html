In a world of overwhelming on-line information access and global
communications, more and more people are asked to provide faster and
more accurate answers based on up-to-date knowledge that is increasingly
more disseminated in vast amounts of information sources. The problem is
especially acute in the world of intelligence analysis, the proposed
application area for this work.
</P>

<P>
There are two key research objectives in this work. First, we propose to
develop techniques to capture and exploit semantic interrelationships
among information items. Our approach will be to use a semantic markup
vocabulary that will enable users to specify semantic annotations not
only the information items themselves but also the links that users make
to relate individual items. We will provide a core vocabulary that will
contain both general and domain-specific terms, and that will be
extensible by users. We will develop tools that will analyze and exploit
these annotations to support users in further analysis, sharing, and
integration.
</P>

<P>
A second objective of this research is to support users in creating new
knowledge fragments from raw information sources and from other
fragments. The key to our approach is to use the semantic annotations to
capture the derivation and rationale of their answers to stated
questions as they progressively generate new knowledge based on their
expertise and viewpoint. Capturing this information results in
significant added value to the original raw information sources. We will
support users to highlight key salient information from large reports
and documents, to add new intermediate knowledge fragments based on
their analysis and integration of existing information, and to finally
put together these fragmented pieces into an overall picture of the
situation.
</P>

<P>
This work is motivated by our previous research on knowledge acquisition
within the <A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/expect">
EXPECT</A> project. 
In order for non-programmers to add knowledge into a system,
they need to be guided step by step through the modelling and 
knowledge representation decisions that knowledge engineers 
normally do.  
Users need to be guided through several steps: 
1) collecting relevant documents
and other information and data sources, 
2) analyzing, grouping, and indexing related information, 
3) relating the information into structured and consistent form,
and 4) formalizing the knowledge into a logic formalism that supports 
automated inference and reasoning.
In our approach, a user could 
use semantic annotations to
specify how each piece of knowledge comes about 
as they follow each of these steps.
The results of each step would remain part of the knowledge base,
so the rationale for each piece of knowledge in the system
is captured. 
This approach would be very useful to maintain the knowledge base
and to integrate it with other reasoning modules,
since the source and rationale for 
each piece of knowledge will be available in the knowledge
base itself instead of disappearing with the knowledge engineers
that created it.
</P>

<P>
The ultimate scientific goal of the project is to 
contribute to the vision of a 
<A HREF="http://www.w3c.org/DesignIssues/Semantic.html">
Sematic Web</A>
that has been put forward by the 
<A HREF="http://www.w3c.org">
World Wide Web consortium</A>.
To this end, we will collaborate with the 
<A HREF="http://dtsn.darpa.mil/iso/programtemp.asp?mode=347">
DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML)</A>
program and the
<A HREF="http://www.daml.org">
DAML extended community</A>.


<P>
Our approach has significant implications and benefits for the
management of knowledge assets that many companies and government
institutions are beginning to practice.  Making documents available
on-line and providing indexing and keyword search are a good first step,
but our approach would support more ambitious information processing and
management than ever before. By providing increasingly more structure to
on-line information, as well as means to customize the way the
information is organized, our approach would enable the development of
intelligent information management systems that can process and retrieve
information in ways specified by the end users themselves. This would
result in a new generation of knowledge management, sharing, and
dissemination systems.
