;;; TO DO/NOTES:
;;; - Add domains and ranges to relations and introduce all relations
;;;   as roles, since EXPECT likes that.
;;; - Add relation hierarchy information such as making `speed' a super
;;;   relation of various speeds.
;;; + Weight should really be `mass', since the weight will differ 
;;;   on the moon and other far-away places.
;;; + Properly merge in CYC's vehicle upper level.
;;; - Think about where to hook up what kind of default information on
;;;   intermediate classes such as LIGHT-TANK.  Maybe instead of attaching
;;;   this information directly to LIGHT-TANK, there should be a class
;;;   AVERAGE-LIGHT-TANK or AVERAGE-IRANIAN-LIGHT-TANK to host it.
;;;   Also, currently, the values on these classes are way to specific.
;;; - Possible name changes:
;;;      max-range-on-road -> cruising-range
;;;      max-tilt -> max-side-slope
;;; - Figure out: What are approach and departure angles?
;;;   Answer: These are the minimum (steepest) angles of a horizontal to
;;;   uphill (approach) or downhill (departure) transition, e.g., _/ , that
;;;   can be negotiated by a vehicle.  This is different from the maximum
;;;   gradient a vehicle can handle, since it depends on the geometry of
;;;   the wheels/tracks, its ground clearance, etc.

#| Excerpts from JANE'S MILITARY VEHICLES AND LOGISTICS 1996-97, page 293

<MD>MODEL : M151 (4 x 4) 362 kg Light Vehicle and Variants

<D6>DESCRIPTION : 
The body and chassis of the M151 are integral and are of all-welded
construction. The layout of the vehicle is conventional, with the
engine at the front and the crew area at the rear with a removable
canvas top and side curtains, and a windscreen that can be folded
forward flat on the bonnet.
  In 1964 the M151 was replaced in production by the M151A1 which had
improved suspension as the earlier model had a tendency to oversteer.
The M151A2 followed in 1970 with modifications to the rear suspension,
dual brake system, collapsible steering wheel, two-speed wipers and
modified lighting.

The M107 and M108 are communications vehicles with the radios
installed in the rear of the vehicle. The passenger seat faces the
rear to enable the radio operator to work his equipment.
  The M718 and M718A1 are ambulance versions and have a crew of two,
a driver and a medical attendant. This version can carry a stretcher
and three seated patients, two stretchers and two seated patients or
three stretcher patients.
  The M825 is fitted with the M40 106 mm recoilless rifle mounted in
the rear. This model was replaced in US Army service by the Hughes TOW
ATGW, with kits available to convert the M825 to the M151A2 standard.
However, during mid-1987 25 M151A2s were converted to M825 standard by
TACOM in order to meet a requirement from Somalia.

;;;;;; APC's
  ;;

;; The M113 was the primary means of transportation for infantry
;; personnel in armored and mechanized infantry units.  Although
;; nearly all Army units now utilize the M2 BFV, the M113 serves as a
;; prime-mover for armored engineer units, and a host of combat
;; support and combat service support functions. In addition, several
;; variants have been developed using the same basic chassis,
;; including: the M981 Fire-Support Team Vehicle (FIST-V); M548A1
;; cargo carrier; M106 mortar carrier (picture available); and M577
;; command vehicle (picture available).

;; Full specs from Jane's for M106A2, M113A1, M113A2, M113A3, M125A2, M577A2:

;; Bradley M2 Infantry Fighting Vehicle

;; The M2 IFV is a fully tracked, lightly armored vehicle that offers
;; significant improvements over the M113 series of armored personnel
;; carriers. The M2 posses greater power, greater acceleration, and an
;; advanced suspension for a significant increase in cross-country
;; speed. Like the M113, the primary purpose of the M2 is to carry
;; infantryman on the battlefield. This "battle taxi" can transport
;; and support them with fire if necessary. The M2 can keep up with
;; the US Army's main battle tank, the M1A1 Abramsseries, and support
;; armor forces as well.

;; Full specs from Jane's for M2, M3:

;;;;;; Main Battle Tanks
  ;;

;; The M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank is the principal tank of the United
;; States Army and Marine Corps. Originally developed and deployed in
;; 1983, The M1 and its variants proved themselves in Operation Desert
;; Shield/ Desert Storm as one of the premier MBTs in the
;; world. Originally (M1) produced with a 105mm main gun, variants
;; produced since 1986 are fitted with a 120mm main gun (M1A1). Its
;; characteristic low profile and angular appearance set it apart from
;; other tanks. The M1's four man crew is protected by "Chobham" armor
;; on glacis and turret, armored bulkheads between turret and engine,
;; blow out panels over the main gun ammunition compartment and an
;; effective fire-suppression system.

;; The M60 (Patton) main battle tank is now primarily found in US
;; Reserve and National Guard units, but served as the primary US main
;; battle tank for two decades prior to the introduction of the
;; M1. Developed from the M48 Patton series, the M60 was fitted with a
;; 105mm main gun and manned by a four-man crew. Criticized for its
;; high profile and limited cross-country mobility, this durable tank
;; proved reliable and underwent many updates over its service
;; life. Initially produced in 1960, over 15,000 M60s were built by
;; Chrysler and first saw service in 1961. Production ended in 1983,
;; but 5,400 older models were converted to the M60A3 variant ending
;; in 1990. This tank saw action with the Israeli forces during the
;; Yom Kippur War in both the Sinai and the Golan Heights. During
;; Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm the 1st Marine Expeditionary
;; Force fielded 210 M60A1s to support the Saudi-Marine effort into
;; Kuwait City.
