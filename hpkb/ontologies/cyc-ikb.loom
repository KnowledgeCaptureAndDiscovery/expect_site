It generally `sounds right' or `feels  natural' to assign causality to agents, rather than some larger or smaller entity.  E.g., it is more natural to say `Fred wrote an essay' than to say `Fred's left hand wrote an essay' or, at the other extreme, to say `The Solar System wrote an essay'.

An instance of #$Artifact is a tangible which was more or less intentionally created by an #$Agent (or a group of #$Agents working together) to serve some purpose or perform some function.  By `created', we don't require that the matter itself be created, it is often just the result of some sort of assemblage or modification process, such as a wooden flute that's been whittled from a tree branch, a sawhorse that's been put together out of boards and nails, a coin that's been minted by embossing or by melting liquid silver into a mold, etc.

Let's consider some positive and negative examples.

In addition to the obvious human artifacts (buildings, tools, textiles, power lines), this collection includes certain sorts of things made by #$Animals, such as bird nests, termite mounds, and beaver dams.

Something which just barely squeaks through the intended meaning of this concept is #$YaleUniversity.  In addition to the abstract legal entity, it consists of a set of physical buildings, furnishings, etc.  By contrast, an organization that had no headquarters building, equipment, tangible property, etc. would not be an artifact.  Similarly, a fictional character such as Tom Sawyer is not an artifact (in the context of the story, Tom is not an artifact because he is a real boy; in the context of the real world, Tom is not an artifact because he has no tangible component whatsoever.)

While some artifacts may be alive, or contain living subparts, we do not intend this collection to encompass all organisms which resulted from normal biological reproductive processes.  Your child is not an artifact.

If you do an oil painting of a house that is an artifact, but much more borderline is what you get if you take a rock and just paint it a solid color, say white.  In general that won't be an artifact unless it serves some purpose, such as marking the shoulder of a roadway, but more questionable cases are if the purpose of the white rock is just `to be sold as art' or `to look pretty.'  The white rock might thus be an artifact in certain contexts, but not in others.

Not every instance of #$Path-Generic (q.v.) is necessarily an instance of #$Artifact.  For example, some channels used for navigation may not be artifacts, because even though they are marked with human artifacts (i.e., channel markers) as locations where ships may safely travel, the channel itself may have been a naturally occurring pre-existing thing -- e.g., the #$EnglishChannel.  If a #$ChannelOrStrait were produced or maintained only by constant dredging, it might count as an artifact.  By contrast, each #$Canal, such as #$SuezCanal, is almost certain to be an #$Artifact.

                (DOCUMENTATION "The collection of all Bayesian Networks intended for probability reasoning.  A #$BayesNet is a network of nodes in which the nodes are random variables that each typically represent the likelihood of a proposition being true (expressed as a real number between zero and one, where zero means certainly false and one means certainly true).  See #$bayesNetOfMicrotheory.  Each #$BayesNet interconnects a set of propositions (or symbols associated with propositions) together forming a #$DirectedAcyclicGraph in which the links (the #$bayesParent link) represent a probabilistic conditional dependence between the directly linked nodes.  Such a network may be established by asserting (or concluding) #$bayesParent predications linking pairs of propositions.  There is a 'closed-world assumption' for every #$BayesNet, in that pairs of propositions not explicitly linked with #$bayesParent are assumed to be not linked.  In addition, a node is #$conditionallyIndependent-Given the truth values of its #$bayesParents (and no other nodes) - from all nodes other than its 'descendants' in the #$BayesNet.  A #$BayesNet is a representation of the entire (strictly positive) joint probability distribution over the random variables.   The #$derivedProbability of a node can be calculated from the probabilities of its #$bayesParents.  (There are always one or more 'source' nodes with no #$bayesParents.)  Theoretically, viewed as evidential links based on the joint probability distribution, the #$bayesParent links are bidirectional.   The direction of the links is obtained formally due to an asymmetry between 'parents' and 'children': the truth of a node induces a conditional dependence among its #$bayesParents (the 'explaining away' effect), which does not seem to apply to its Bayesian 'child' nodes.  Most Bayesian network theorists consider that the directions on the links correspond to the direction of causal influence, and hence to the direction of time. The name 'Bayesian' is due to the Reverend Thomas Bayes, whose inversion rule was published posthumously in 1763, and later developed by Laplace.  Bayesian Networks were devised chiefly by Judea Pearl in the 1980s.")))

To illustrate, let's consider a predicate with a lower #$arity, say (#$mother CHILD MOM), which says that the mother of CHILD is MOM.  The #$arg2Format for #$mother should be #$SingleEntry, since an animal can have only one biological mother.





(2) If the #$arg3Format of PRED is #$SetTheFormat, then there may be any number of assertions with different terms in the third argument position, but sharing the same values for arguments 1, 2, 4, and 5.  E.g., the #$arg1Format for #$mother should be #$SetTheFormat, since a female can have multiple children.





(3) If the #$arg3Format of PRED is #$IntervalEntry, then there may be multiple assertions sharing the values of 1, 2, 4, and 5, but with different terms in the 3rd argument; however, all the values for the 3rd argument must be overlapping elements of #$ScalarInterval (q.v.).

An instance of #$HumanOccupationConstruct is an artificial construction belonging to the collection #$ContainerProduct, and its #$primaryFunction is as a place in which humans perform activities.  Some large subsets include 
   (a) instances of #$HumanShelterConstruction (e.g., houses); 
   (b) sub-regions within a #$HumanShelterConstruction or within any building which are intended for human use (e.g., rooms, shower stalls), and 
   (c) regions in any transportation vehicle which are designed for human occupancy (e.g., the cockpit, passenger compartment).  

Note:  Some buildings which are not themselves instances of #$HumanOccupationConstruct, such as #$HooverDam, may have a sub-region which is a #$HumanOccupationConstruct (e.g., the control room at the top of the dam).

Note:  The collection #$HumanOccupationConstruct is broad enough to include tents, boiler rooms, elevator shafts, steam tunnels, and the space inside the #$LincolnMemorialInWashingtonDC.  Thus, an instance of #$HumanOccupationConstruct need not be strictly #$Indoors (q.v.), since #$Indoors is meant to include many characteristics that those places do not necessarily share (such as humanly comfortable temperature, lighting at night, not terribly noisy or windy, clean).  We therefore do not make the default assertion that a #$HumanOccupationConstruct is #$Indoors; however, an instance of #$HumanOccupationConstruct is certainly not a purely #$OutdoorLocation (q.v.), so we DO assert that those two collections are disjoint.  Certain subsets of #$HumanOccupationConstruct, however, do have `indoor' characteristics, and so we assert (for example) that anything found inside instances of #$RoomInAConstruction or #$ModernShelterConstruction is found #$Indoors.

Isolating the `illocutionary force' of a communication allows us to characterize the intention of a speaker; e.g., whether s/he means to assert that the described state of affairs in fact holds; or to express a desire that such a state of affairs hold; or to command someone to make that state of affairs hold; or to offer to make the state of affairs hold.  S/he may even intend to make something true by stating it (e.g., ``I name this ship `The Intrepid'.''). 
Usually, apprehending a speaker's intention is important for understanding what s/he means and what s/he intends the hearer to do.  Although illocutionary forces can be represented propositionally, they are not generally communicated so explicitly.  For example, questions in English are typically communicated by inverting subject-object word order and raising one's intonation at the end of the utterance.  (The intonation marker so strongly indicates a question that it may suffice without the inverted word order, as in `You are going tonight' uttered with a rising intonation.)  Commands in English typically have an (unexpressed) understood subject and perhaps a forceful tone.  In every culture and language there are conventional sets of commonly used illocutionary forces which would be the subsets of #$IllocutionaryForce for that culture; e.g., in English, they include #$Inform contexts, #$Request, #$Offer, #$Promise, and #$Query.
Note: although in this comment #$IllocutionaryForce is explained in terms of utterances, it applies to communication generally; so `speaker' and `listener' should be broadly interpreted to mean, respectively, any #$senderOfInfo and #$recipientOfInfo.

Thus, #$Individual includes (among other things) physical objects, temporal subabstractions of physical objects, numbers, relations, and groups (see #$Group).  An element of #$Individual may have parts or a structure (including parts that are discontinuous); but NO instance of #$Individual can have elements or subsets.

Important distinction:  Though an element of #$Individual may have parts (e.g., #$physicalParts or #$groupMembers), that individual is NOT the same thing as the collection containing those same parts.  For example, your car is an individual, but the collection of all the parts of your car is an instance of #$Collection.  The latter -- the collection of parts of your car -- is an abstract collection; it doesn't have a location, it doesn't have a top speed, etc. -- it's just a collection! -- but it does have subsets, supersets, and members.  Similarly: `Bill Clinton's immediate family' is an individual; however, the collection of persons who belong to that family is a collection. One final example: A company belongs to #$Individual and is distinct from the collection of its employees (which #$isa #$Collection).")))

Flexibility in the representation of quantities is allowed in assertions made with the binary predicates that are elements of #$IntervalBasedQuantitySlot.  Each of these predicates, like those in their superset #$QuantitySlot, is a binary predicate whose second argument must be an element of #$ScalarInterval, i.e., an interval or point representing the value of some measurement.  For example, take the predicate #$heightOfObject, which relates an object to its vertical length.  Although we suppose that in reality there is only a single distance that is the height of some one particular object, our measurement systems are in practice less precise--and typically we need a measurement only within a certain tolerance.  For example, in measuring the #$heightOfObject of a person, usually a measurement to the nearest inch or centimeter will do.  Or we may be even less detailed in our descriptions, perhaps caring only whether someone is more than four feet tall, or `Tall enough to ride' on an amusement park ride.  By allowing an #$IntervalEntry #$Format (qq.v.) in the second argument of the measuring predicate, we are telling Cyc that it's okay to describe the (e.g.) #$heightOfObject in several different ways, with varying levels of precision, SO LONG AS all of the measurements asserted for the same object `overlap'.  For example, it is consistent to say both that Jenny is 4'10'' tall, between four and five feet tall, and that she is `Tall enough to ride' the Dodgems (provided that `Tall enough to ride' is an interval whose minimum is at 4'10'' or lower).  Even though there is only one height of a person in reality, using an #$IntervalBasedQuantitySlot allows us to represent that height in many different ways, avoiding contradictions while still checking for consistency.  For example, asserting both that Jeff's #$heightOfObject is 5'9'' and in the range 4.5-5.5 feet tall is an inconsistency.")))

                (DOCUMENTATION "The collection of all microtheories, or `mts' for short.  Microtheories implement contexts in Cyc.  Each mt serves to group a set of assertions together that share some common assumptions.  Thus each mt can be thought of as having two parts: a corpus of assertions that represent the `content' of the mt, and a separate corpus of assertions that represent the `assumptions' which are being made.  E.g., in a normal modern everyday life microtheory, there might be hundreds of content assertions such as `drivers are at least 16 years old', and there might be dozens of assumption assertions about that microtheory's content, such as `all actors are assumed to be law-abiding'.   You can think of the assumptions as a set of extra conjuncts on the left hand side (the antecedent or `if'-part) of every content assertion in the mt.  

Each assertion in the knowledge base must be explicitly stated to be true in at least one mt.  It will then (by inference) also be true in all the more specialized contexts.  If something is true in the `life in North America' mt, then it should by default be true in the `life in Canada' mt.  I.e., the microtheories are organized into a generalization/specialization lattice by the predicate #$genlMt (q.v.), just as collections are organized into such a lattice by #$genls, and just as predicates are organized into such a lattice by #$genlPreds.  Just as a collection may have several incommensurable supersets, so too a microtheory may have several incommensurable #$genlMts.  Just as each and every collection must have some explicitly recorded superset (except for #$Thing), each and every mt must have some (expicitly recorded) more general mt (except for the #$BaseKB, which is the most general context, containing universal, timeless truths).  Just as a Cyc concept may have multiple incommensurable sets of which it is an element (via #$isa), so too a Cyc assertion may be declared to be true in a set of incommensurable mts.

Every query is made in some mt, so the answer you get might very well depend on the mt in which you ask the question.  Let's call the current context C1, for the remainder of this paragraph.  The only assertions which can be used in C1 to answer the query are those assertions which were explicitly stated to be true in C1 or in some more general mt than C1.  But what if you want and need something like assertion P, to answer the question, but P doesn't fit that criterion, though P is true in some other mts that are unrelated to C1?  You can `import' or `lift' P into C1, by conjoining to its left hand side (if-part) the various assumptions of a context C999 in which P is known to be true.  I.e., what you actually conclude to be true in C1 is an assertion of the form `if a1 and a2 and... then P', where a1, a2,... are the assumptions of a context in which P holds (but which are NOT implied by assumptions of C1).  When there are several contexts to choose from, from which to import P, you will usually prefer the context whose assumptions are most similar to C1's assumptions, so there will be few extra conjuncts that need to be inserted in the `lifting' process.

There is an implicit third component to each #$Microtheory, namely the Cyc terms which are `known about' in that mt.  E.g., #$Lenat is not `known about' in a microtheory set in prehistoric times; #$PhotochemicalEnergyTransduction is not `known about' in a microtheory representing things that a toddler believes to be true; etc.  Unlike the content and the assumptions, however, there is no need to explicitly collect into one list all the terms which are `known about'.  Rather, one could compute such a list by looking at all the terms which are mentioned anywhere in the content assertions of the mt.

Note that #$Microtheory is itself a `first-class object', as is each and every element of that collection --- e.g., #$CommercialBuyingMt, #$WorldGeographyMt, #$USHealthcareMt, #$HumanSocialLifeMt, etc.  The assertions about a #$Microtheory are just like any other Cyc assertions.  

Note that one important predicate we haven't mentioned here yet is the one that says `assertion P is true in microtheory M'.  That predicate is #$ist.  Thus:  (#$ist M P).

Note that another important predicate we haven't mentioned here yet is the one that says `microtheory M has the proposition P as a domain assumption'.  Thus: (#$domainAssumptions M P).")))

The moving object need not move completely out of its original spatial extent, thus a building moving one foot to the left undergoes a #$Movement-TranslationEvent. So:  One special subset of translational movements includes those in which the movement ends in the same place it started from (e.g., one lap of a race car around the Indianapolis race trace; a trip to the grocery store and back); this subset is #$Translation-NoLocationChange (including its subset #$Translation-RoundTrip).  The other case is where the #$fromLocation and #$toLocation of a #$Movement-TranslationEvent are different; in that case, the movement event is also an element of #$Translation-LocationChange (e.g., the movement of the baseball during a home run hit by Roger Maris.)

object or set of object going from one place or set of places to another
place or set of places, or from one rotational orientation to another rotational orientation. Each instance of #$MovementEvent is a rotation or translation of some instance of #$PartiallyTangible, where movement occurs relative to a frame of reference which is not part of the #$objectMoving.  Thus, Neil Armstrong's stepping onto the Moon's surface from the lunar landing module is an element of #$MovementEvent.

Note: #$MovementEvent is the most generic collection for physical movements.  For representing specific events, one or more of the following subsets of #$MovementEvent may be more precise: #$Movement-TranslationEvent, #$Movement-Rotation, #$Movement-Periodic, #$Movement-NonPeriodic, #$Translation-Flow, #$Translation-Complete, #$Translation-SingleTrajectory, #$Translation-MultiTrajectory.  Some questions to consider in selecting the best collection to represent a physical movement include: (1) is the movement translational or rotational motion? (2) is it periodic or nonperiodic? (3) does it involve a discrete motion (i.e., an object's moving completely from one place to another) or a continuous flow? (4) does it involve a change of location or no location change? (5) does it involve a single pathway or more than one?  Note on what is NOT included in #$MovementEvent: Consider a person's raising her hand and waving, or a tree's bending as its branches sway in a strong wind, while the person and the tree remain in the same place. The movements of the person and the tree do NOT qualify as instances of #$MovementEvent, because the `doer' in any element of #$MovementEvent must rotate or translate as a whole.  The hand movement and the movement of the branches do, however, qualify as objects moving in the proper sense.

An obligation can exist and be understood without identifying another particular agent as the `holder' of the obligation -- and that may be true, even if the beneficiary (#$obligationOwedTo) can be identified.  For example, assuming that parents have an obligation to care for their children, it is not clear with whom a parent has `agreed' to take care of his or her child.  Some common ways to incur an obligation are through social transactions (e.g., family duties, friendship, favors) or through financial transactions (e.g., a #$PaymentObligation).   In addition, obligations may be imposed on those who are subject to one or more instances of #$CodeOfConduct, e.g., #$LegalCode-ModernUnitedStates, #$SportsRulesOf-BoxingSportsEvent, #$OfficeCodeOfConductMt.")))

The most familiar case is for numbers, in which orders of magnitudes typically correspond with powers of 10; thus, in any given numerical quantity, the 100's dominate the 10's or the units, which are negligible with respect to the hundreds.  In Cyc, we can identify the significant intervals for any measurable property.  For example, for #$Time-Quantity, some intervals which represent orders of magnitude are: #$AFewSecondsDuration, #$AFewMinutesDuration, #$AFewHoursDuration, #$AFewDaysDuration, #$AFewWeeksDuration, etc.  Similar scales could be identified for any measurable property.  Moreover, orders of magnitude for the same measurable property may differ between microtheories; e.g., the orders of magnitude for #$Time-Quantity in a `GeologicalTimeMt' would be much larger than those listed above, which are relevant for human perceptions and activities.  



Any two attributes which represent amounts of the same kind of property (e.g., time, distance) and which are also elements of #$OrderOfMagnitudeInterval will be assumed to differ so substantially in size that the smaller one (and values associated with it) will be insignificant compared to the larger interval (and values associated with it).  That is, in general and as a default, if ORD1 and ORD2 are two different elements of #$OrderOfMagnitudeInterval which are also elements of the same type of #$AttributeValue (e.g., #$Speed, #$Mass, #$Density), then one is negligible with respect to the other.  To know which dominates the other, we need additional knowledge about their relative size, e.g., that ORD2 is a #$followingValue of (i.e., 'bigger' than) ORD1.  See also #$negligibleWRT, #$followingValue.  The predicate #$orderOfMagnitude (q.v.) is used to relate particular quantities to the appropriate element of #$OrderOfMagnitudeInterval.

An instance of #$PathSystem may consist of real-world (#$PartiallyTangible) things, or #$Intangibles like a graph (or #$Multigraph) in Graph Theory, in which nodes are linked by links.  But unlike a graph in Graph Theory, there can be many path-points on a path between designated nodes.  These non-node path-points can be discrete, dense or even continuous.  Such a path system does not have to be 'connected' (in the sense that for any points X and Y in the system, there must be a path connecting them, see #$ConnectedPathSystem).  Each instance SYS of #$PathSystem consists of a nonempty set of 'points', a subset of it called 'nodes', a set of 'links', and optionally a set of 'loops'.  Here, 'point' is a nonempty set of #$Things called 'points in SYS' (see #$pointInSystem).  The set 'node' is a nonempty subset of 'point' (see #$nodeInSystem).  Link is a (possibly empty) set of (primitive) paths whose elements are called 'links in SYS' (see #$linkInSystem).  Loop is a (possibly empty) set of (primitive) cycles whose elements are called 'loops in SYS' (see #$loopInSystem).  To finish your definition of a path system SYS, you need to specify, using the predicates below (other than the four mentioned above), which link is between which two nodes, and which point is on which link, and which node is on which loop, etc.  The rest should be determined by your set-up of the system.  For example, #$pathBetween can be used to specify the 'end points' of each link, #$pointOnPath can be used to specify which point is on which link, #$pointOnCycle specifies which node is on which loop, and, when more points than the end-points of a link are desired to be on the link, #$betweenOnPath can be used to specify the relative positions of all points on a link.  But there are more convenient ways to set up your SYS.  For example, if you use #$linkBetweenInSystem which is a combination of other predicates, it will give you what you need when using #$linkInSystem, #$pathBetween, #$nodeInSystem, #$pointOnPath to setup your system (except that this will not give you those assertions about isolated nodes or points on a link between its end points).

Each element of #$Predicate is a relationship in Cyc which takes some number of arguments to yield a well-formed CycL formula; each of those arguments must be of some particular type.  For example, the predicate #$genls, which represents the subset/superset relation between collections, takes two arguments; each argument must be an element of #$Collection.  The numbers and types of arguments to particular predicates are specified by explicit assertions using #$arity, #$arg1Isa, #$arg2Isa, etc., #$arg1Genl, #$arg2Genl, etc.  Our example #$genls has #$arity 2, and both its #$arg1Isa and its #$arg2Isa have the value #$Collection.  
Informally, you can think of elements of #$Predicate as functions that always return either true or false.  More formally, when an element of #$Predicate is applied to the legal number and type of arguments, an expression is formed which is a well-formed formula (wff) in CycL.  Such expressions are called `atomic formulas' if they contain variables, and `gafs' (short for `ground atomic formulas') if they contain no variables. Quantifiers and logical operators are excluded from #$Predicate; see #$Quantifier, #$LogicalConnective.
Currently (July 1996), the KB includes predicates of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 arguments; i.e., #$arity may have a value between 1 and 5, inclusive.  The KB also includes some predicates of variable arity (see #$VariableArityRelation).

They are both abstract entities, lacking spatial and temporal properties.  More specifically, they (can) have elements, and hence may stand to one another in set-theoretic relations such as #$subsetOf and #$disjointWith.  Nevertheless, sets and collections differ in two important respects.  Every collection is associated with an intensional criterion for membership -- a more or less natural property or group of properties possessed by its members.  (The criterion for membership need not, and often will not, be precisely definable in any language.)  Collections are thus akin to kinds.  In contrast, the elements of a set are not required to be homogeneous in any respect; any things whatsoever may together comprise the members of a set.  The second major difference between sets and collections is that no two distinct sets can be co-extensional (be such that every element of one is an element of the other and conversely).  Sets are, so to speak, identified on the basis of their extensions.  Collections, on the other hand, are identified by their intensional criteria for membership.  So collections which have exactly the same elements may be distinct, differing in their respective membership criteria.")))

                (DOCUMENTATION "#$SiblingDisjointCollection captures a very important concept, but one that is rarely given a name.  There are many sets of sets for which any two member sets either will be disjoint (i.e., have no intersection) or else one will be a subset of the other.  For instance, consider the various types (i.e., sets) of animals in the usual Linnaean taxonomy:  Vertebrate, Bird, Dog, Mammal, Invertebrate, Person, etc.; Vertebrates and Invertebrates are mutually disjoint, while Bird, Mammal, Dog, and Person are all subsets of Vertebrate.  Dog and Person are disjoint with each other, but each of them is a subset of Vertebrate.  All of the Linnaean sets, or collections, of animals can be grouped together into one set, or collection, of sets, which in turn is an instance of #$SiblingDisjointCollection.   
It turns out that the real situation --- and the real definition of #$SiblingDisjointCollection --- is slightly more complicated than that.  Consider types of appliances: toasters, cars, shavers, clocks, etc.  Is the set of such appliance-types a #$SiblingDisjointCollection, the way we defined it above, for types of animals?  Almost, but not quite.  One could have an appliance-type `ClockRadio', which would be the set of all clock radios, and clearly each clock radio is both a clock and a radio, yet neither #$Clock nor #$RadioReceiver is a subset of the other.  So if we have some item that purports to be both a clock and radio, that is okay if one of the following three conditions is met:
(1) the collection #$Clock is known to be a subset of #$RadioReceiver;
(2) the collection #$RadioReceiver is known to be a subset of #$Clock;
(3) there is already defined a collection X which is a subset of both #$Clock and #$RadioReceiver.
More formally, the axiom that defines #$SiblingDisjointCollection is as follows: SIB is an element of #$SiblingDisjointCollection if and only if:
(#$implies
   (#$and 
       (#$isa C1 SIB) 
       (#$isa C2 SIB) (#$isa C1-EL C1)
       (#$different C1 C2))
   (#$or 
       (#$not (#$isa C1-EL C2)) 
       (#$thereExists C3 (#$and (#$genls C3 C2) (#$genls C3 C1) (#$isa C1-EL C3)))))
That axiom, together with the minimization of #$genls, gives us the following characterization of our concept:  If we have a collection SIB that is an element of #$SiblingDisjointCollection, and if we take two elements C1 and C2 of that collection SIB, then each element of C1 which is not an element of a common specialization (C3) of C1 and C2, MUST NOT BE an element of C2.
In cases where there are a few exceptions --- that is, a couple of elements of SIB might have some overlap --- but it is undesirable to explicitly create a new reified constant (like `ClockRadio', above) for that intersection, Cyc allows you to use an explicit mechanism to override the #$SiblingDisjointCollection constraints for a particular C1 and C2; namely, you would assert to Cyc (#$siblingDisjointExceptions C1 C2).

(Most Cyc users don't need to know the following details, which are supplied only for the curious.)







Suppose we tell Cyc that every animal has a birth date; i.e., for each animal, there exists a date such that the animal was born on that date --- in CycL, (#$implies (#$isa ?x #$Animal)(#$thereExists ?y (#$birthDate ?x ?y))).  In response to that CycL formula, Cyc would create a new element of #$SkolemFunction -- we might call it the `BirthDateFn' -- whose single argument would be an animal and whose resultant value would be a date, namely, that animal's date of birth.  Subsequently, Cyc would automatically use the `BirthDateFn' in asserting our rule, eliminating the need for a `#$thereExists'.  Our formula would thus be rewritten by the system, as follows:







(#$implies 

   (#$and

     (#$isa ?x #$Animal)

     (#$termOfUnit ?y (`BirthDateFn' ?x)))

One could, in principle, separately reify (name) the #$TimeInterval which is the period of existence of any #$SomethingExisting, or the period of time during which any #$Event occurred, but in practice that is rarely useful.

We may choose to use a more detailed representation of the traversal, i.e., use a #$PathChain made of more, but shorter, paths.  For example, we may use several paths to replace a cycle in CHAIN if we want to be clear about the direction in that part of the traversal, or we may have to replace a path in CHAIN by several 'shorter' paths if we want to preserve the fact that the object moved backward at a small part of PATH and then resumed its original direction.  In summary, a traversal is a constraint on a trajectory and a characterization of it in terms of traversing pre-existing #$Path-Generics.   Technically, a #$Traversal from A to B can be expressed as (#$TraversalFn CHAIN) where CHAIN is a #$PathChain such that the first item in CHAIN is A and the last is B (we can assert: (#$traversalFrom (#$TraversalFn CHAIN) A) and (#$traversalTo (#$TraversalFn CHAIN) B)).  Related constants include #$TraversalFn, #$traversalFrom, #$traversalTo, #$pointOnTraversal, #$subTraversals, #$traversalPassesThrough, #$traversalInSystem, etc.  Note that a #$Traversal, unlike a #$Path-Generic, can cross itself, i.e., can 'pass through' a point on it many times.   (Mathematically: given a #$PathSystem or #$CustomarySystemOfLinks, a #$Traversal of it is a directed path that has a homomorphism into that system.)")))

Note that #$causes-PropProp means more than #$implies, of course: there is a temporal ordering involved, there is a presumed mechanism of causation, etc.  Unlike #$implies, #$causes-PropProp is not reflexive; one would not say that p1 causes p1, even though p1 implies p1.  Another difference between #$implies and #$causes-PropProp is that #$causes-PropProp is a predicate, not a logical connective.  Just because (#$causes-PropProp p1 p2) is true that does NOT entail that (#$causes-PropProp (#$not p2) (#$not p1)) is true.  Note that (#$causes-PropProp p1 p2) is generally a more accurate way of talking about causation than saying that some event e1 causes event e2 (which one can do in Cyc, using the predicate #$causes-EventEvent) since often there are a few key aspects of e1 that cause a few key aspects of e2, and the remaining details of e1 and e2 were, to first order, irrelevant.  Note that, similarly, (#$causes-PropProp p1 p2) is generally a more accurate way of talking about causation than saying that some situation (see #$Situation) SIT caused something to be true (which one can do in Cyc, using the predicate #$causes-SitProp) since often there is some specific aspect of the situation that is the cause of the proposition's becoming satisfied.  Because this predicate is asymetric and since effect (p2) can not temporally precede cause (p1), #$causes-PropProp may not be used to express mutual causation, e.g. feedback loops for which it may be said that two events (probably more process-like) cause each other.

For example, it's the case that (#$contemporaryInArg #$awareOf 1).  So from the assertion (#$holdsIn (#$YearFn 1992) (#$awareOf Fred #$GeorgeWashington)), we can conclude (given that Fred is a #$TemporalThing) that Fred was alive throughout (temporally subsumes) 1992.  But it's not the case that (#$contemporaryInArg #$awareOf 2).  And indeed we wouldn't want to conclude that #$GeorgeWashington was alive throughout 1992.  In general (with the qualifications indicated below), an assertion (#$holdsIn TIME (PRED ... ARGN ...)), with PRED such that (#$contemporaryInArg PRED N) and ARGN a #$TemporalThing, licenses the conclusion (#$temporallySubsumes ARGN TIME).  And an assertion (#$holdsSometimeDuring TIME (PRED ... ARGN ...)) licenses the conclusion (#$temporallyIntersects ARGN TIME).  Although what constitutes a moment can vary with context, for most microtheories explicit considerations of temporal granularity (in this sense) don't come into play.  In particular, in the case of most microtheories, one doesn't have to worry about the possibility of gaps in the fabric of time between moments.  (Such gaps would undermine the conclusion above about temporal subsumption.)  Another qualification is that ARGN is not a #$TemporallyIndexicalFirstOrderTerm; in practice, it almost never is.  In order for a predicate PRED to be contemporary in its Nth argument-place, the arity of PRED must be greater than or equal to N, and the argument-type of the Nth argument-place of PRED must be non-disjoint with #$TemporalThing (or, more generally, the intersection of the argument-types of the Nth argument-place of PRED must be non-disjoint with #$TemporalThing).  This is to bar cases in which a predicate would otherwise trivially qualify as contemporary in its Nth argument-place.

(This is a special #$ReifiableFunction whose principal reason-for-being is to facilitate the inference heuristics associated with assertions about covering.)")))

Another way of thinking of this is that the various `content' assertions of M only apply to objects that satisfy all its #$domainAssumptions.  Yes, that means that the `domain of quantifiers' (#$forAll and #$thereExists) is limited to the universe of such objects.

For example, the #$duration of `the Mondays during May of 1996' is (#$DaysDuration 4), whereas the #$measure of that same temporal object is (#$DaysDuration 22).
Note:  Unfortunately, in some disciplines, such as Real Analysis, these two terms' definitions are switched!  In such contexts, one could assert to Cyc that the preferred denotation of #$duration was #$Measure-TheWord, and that the preferred denotation of #$measure was #$Duration-TheWord, but notice that the two concepts --- #$measure and #$duration --- are still distinct and useful in that discipline, they just happen to have different names there.")))

(#$thereExists VAR FORM) means that FORM is true in at least one case (and possibly more) in which all occurrences of the variable VAR in FORM are replaced by an object in the Cyc universe.

[Developer-level footnote:  There are many `flavors' of quantification `on the market' these days; here is how the Cyc system currently handles axioms that involve #$thereExists:



When processing an FI-ASK about whether (#$thereExists VAR FORM) is true or not, Cyc determines extensionally whether or not any known VAR (anything in the knowledge base) satisfies FORM (makes it true.)



When processing an FI-PROVE about whether (#$thereExists VAR FORM) is true or not, Cyc tries to construct an intensional proof (at least at a default-true level) that there must exist some value of VAR --- which may or may not already be known in the KB -- for which FORM must be true.



When processing an FI-ASSERT in which a user or program tells Cyc that (#$thereExists VAR FORM) is true, Cyc records the assertion intensionally so that it can later serve as part of an intensional proof, when some future FI-PROVE request is processed.  It does this by creating a new #$SkolemFunction (q.v.).  



When modus ponens is used with a rule of the form (#$implies ANTECEDENT (#$thereExists VAR FORM)), and the formula ANTECEDENT is true, then Cyc will generate a new term for VAR, add that to its language, and assert that the new term satisfies FORM.]")))

For example, to say that every person is a mammal, we could assert: (#$forAll ?X (#$implies (#$isa ?X #$Person) (#$isa ?X #$Mammal))).  In addition, CycL follows a convention that allows #$forAll to be omitted; that is, when no explicit quantifier is used, seemingly unbound variables inside formulas are assumed to be universally quantified.  With that convention, the sample assertion could be written more compactly as: (#$implies (#$isa ?X #$Person) (#$isa ?X #$Mammal)).



[Developer-level footnote:  There are many `flavors' of quantification `on the market' these days; here is how the Cyc system currently handles axioms that involve #$forAll:



When processing an FI-ASK about whether an assertion of the form (#$forAll VAR FORM) is true or not, Cyc determines extensionally whether or not any known VAR (anything in the knowledge base) could make FORM false.



When processing an FI-PROVE about whether an assertion of the form (#$forAll VAR FORM) is true or not, Cyc tries to construct an intensional proof (at least at a default-true level) that FORM must be true regardless of what VAR is ever inserted therein.



When processing an FI-ASSERT in which a user or program tells Cyc that an assertion of the form (#$forAll VAR FORM) is true, Cyc records it intensionally so that it can later serve as part of an intensional proof, when some future FI-PROVE request is processed.]")))

#$High, #$Medium, and #$Low for GENERIC-VALUE. Importance is a highly
context dependent notion.  This context dependence may be determined
by the goals of the current conversation, or by the properties of the
#$Microtheory that a given #$importanceOfThingInSet assertion occurs
in, or by some implicit agent's judgements about what is important, or
some other factors.  Concluding importance is a heuristic matter,
i.e. there are often not hard and fast rules concluding
#$importanceOfThingInSet except in more narrowly defined contexts.
Thus, it would probably not be correct to write a rule such as 'If
?STATE is one of the 10 biggest U.S. states its importance is high.'
unless, for example, such an assertion were stated in a conversational
microtheory where conversational agents share the belief that 'the
bigger a thing is, the more important it is'.  On the other hand, a
rule such as 'If ?STATE is one of the 10 oldest U.S. states its
importance is high.'  might be of some worth in the 'HistoriansMt' in
which history experts would be identified as the aforementioned
implicit importance evaluating agents.  Finally, a rule such as 'If
?STATE is one of the 10 most populous U.S. state's then its importance
is high' is a rule that could be re-used in a wider variety of
applications.  The original motivation of this constant was to preserve the level of vagueness in a natural language statement such as 'Houston is

OBJ2.  #$inRegion is a general locative predicate which has a large,
diverse group of specializations; for this reason it is hard to
characterize its meaning succinctly.  The primary use of #$inRegion is
to generalize over all these specializations.  The sufficient
conditions for #$inRegion are the disjunction of the sufficient
conditions for its specializations (but see EXCEPTIONS).  Every
assertion in the extent of #$inRegion is, in theory, in the extent of
at least one of its specializations (again, see EXCEPTIONS).  When
considering using #$inRegion, it is always best to first consult its
specializations -- particularly when maximum specificity is important,
e.g. when the considered usage is a GAF or the consequent of a rule.
By contrast, if one wishes to write a very general antecedent with a
locative predicate, #$inRegion is more likely to be appropriate.  Two
important immediate specializations of #$inRegion are
#$objectFoundInLocation, whose arg2 is necessarily not a part of arg1,
and #$physicalDecompositions, whose arg1 necessarily *is* a part of
arg2 (note the switch of argument order; #$physicalDecompositions is a
value on #$genlInverse, not on #$genlPreds).  #$spatiallySubsumes is
another important immediate specialization.  Some examples: Given that
Cup1 is on Stool5, we may write (#$inRegion Cup1 Stool5).  Note,
however, that #$on-Physical is probably a more appropriately precise
relation.  If Cup1 were under the stool, (#$inRegion Cup1 Stool5) would
probably be false.  Likewise if Cup1 were suspended 5 centimeters
above the stool then (#$inRegion Cup1 Stool5) would be false.  On the
other hand, if Cup1 were on a 5 centimeter high stack of papers, it
would be consistent to assert (#$inRegion Cup1 Stool5) because
(#$objectFoundInLocation Cup1 Stool5) is true.  Given that Fish1 is in
Ocean2 we may write (#$inRegion Fish1 Ocean2).  (But
#$in-ImmersedFully is probably more precise.)  About Car03 on Highway2
we may write (#$inRegion Car03 Highway2), although #$on-Physical is a
more precise rendering.  If Joe is in Texas we may write (#$inRegion
Joe Texas) although #$objectFoundInLocation is more appropriately
precise.  Given a gorge which has a cliff as a part, one may write
(#$inRegion Cliff01 Gorge01) although (#$surfaceParts Gorge01 Cliff01
would be a more precise rendering.  EXCEPTIONS: The cavities denoted
(#$InteriorFn OBJ) may or may not be a part of OBJ depending on one's
viewpoint.  To accommodate both the affirmative and negative answers
to this question we shall conclude (#$inRegion (#$InteriorFn OBJ) OBJ)
which is agnostic as to whether (#$InteriorFn OBJ) is or is not a part
of OBJ.  More specialized contexts may use more specific predicates
(e.g. #$objectFoundInLocation vs #$physicalParts) for the relationship
between e.g. a sponge and the holes in a sponge.  There are currently
(Jan 98) no other exceptions.  As they may acrete, it will be
important to periodically re-examine the rules on #$inRegion to
determine if a new specialization of it should be introduced.")))

For example, #$Killing-Biological and #$PhysicallyAttackingAnAgent are both elements of #$DefaultDisjointScriptType, which in turn is an element of #$SiblingDisjointCollection.  The exception is useful in this case because it lifts the constraint that physically attacking and killing an agent must be disjoint from each other, while letting us continue to conclude that killing and attacking are each disjoint from many other kinds of actions.  By asserting (#$siblingDisjointExceptions #$Killing-Biological #$PhysicallyAttackingAnAgent), we block the disjointness constraint between those two collections, without disturbing the constraints between each of those collections and all the other instances of their parent (disjoint) collection, #$DefaultDisjointScriptType.

Assertions with #$termOfUnit are created by the system when a certain kind of non-atomic term (NAT) first appears in a Cyc formula; such a NAT consists of a Cyc function that is an element of #$ReifiableFunction, together with the correct number and type of arguments.  When such a NAT is first used in a formula, the Cyc system automatically creates a Cyc-constant data-structure to reify the NAT.  A name is automatically assigned to the new constant (i.e., the data-structure) by the Cyc system; currently (1997), the system is using for most of those constant names a string which is identical to the NAT.  One should not be misled by that into thinking that #$termOfUnit is a specialization of #$equals. 

The predicate #$termOfUnit maps between the system-generated data-structure and the original non-atomic term.  (#$termOfUnit NAT-CONSTANT NAT-EXPRESSION) tells us that the constant data-structure NAT-CONSTANT was created to reify the value of the non-atomic term NAT-EXPRESSION.

If, eg, we are dealing with a case of a vehicle that operates from a fixed base of operations, such as a #$FighterPlane, the effective operating range will ordinarily be one-half the absolute #$vehicleRange, since ordinarily provision will be made for the plane's returning to base.  However, we may well want to consider special cases where this provision is not made.  Conversely, in cases where aerial refueling is a possibility, the actual effective operating range will be some multiple of the #$vehicleRange, or may even be indefinite.")))

  (DOCUMENTATION "#$GeographicalAgents (#$Country, #$City, #$Neighborhood, ...) are #$Agents which can be considered to have a specific territorial expanse.  In some cases, it is useful to consider the territory and the agent to be different entities, while in others it is useful to use the agent as a referent for the territory.  CYC allows for both of these interpretations, in different contexts.  In a physical geography microtheory (#$PhysicalGeographyMt and its submicrotheories) #$Agents are disjoint from places and '(#$TerritoryFn <#$Agent>)' is used to specify the territory.  In 'dualist' microtheories (submicrotheories of #$DualistGeopoliticalMt) the elements of #$GeopoliticalEntity and #$GeographicalAgent are both #$Agents and #$GeographicalRegions.  These microtheories need not reify the #$physicalExtent of the entity, but just state geographic aspects directly about the agent/region combination.  Generic geography microtheories (e.g. #$WorldGeographyMt and #$UnitedStatesGeographyMt) are used for assertions that do not require the specification of whether or not a #$GeographicalAgent is to be treated as a #$GeographicalRegion.  For example, state (#$geopoliticalSubdivisions COUNTRY CITY) or (#$surroundsHorizontally #$AtlanticOcean #$Iceland-TheIsland) in a generic geography microtheory, (#$bordersOn #$Mali #$Niger) in a 'dualist' microtheory, and (#$isa #$WallisAndFutunaIslands #$Archipelago) in a physical geography microtheory if it is being defined as a colony in a dualist microthory.")))

 (:ABOUT |IsaVsMainConstituentVsConstituents| |SharedNote|
  (DOCUMENTATION "When to use #$isa, #$mainConstituent, or #$constituents.  We develop the following example as a basis for explaining the differences.  

Consider X, where (#$isa X #$Water). If we add some other substance(s) to X, to the point where the mixture acquires some salient characteristic(s) different from #$Water while retaining all the main properties, then we should assert (#$mainConstituent X W), where W is the original water -- i.e., (#$isa W #$Water) -- and X is the whole new mixture of W with some other stuff(s).  Suppose we add enough enough other stuff that the physical properties of the mixture become significantly different from those of water; then we should assert only (#$constituents X W).  

#$isa - Use #$isa if X would commonly be referred to as `water', including cases in which a small number of minor characteristics are different due to some admixture.   

Examples (arguably, 3 and 4 are borderline cases): 

1. An instance of (#$PureFn #$Water) #$isa #$Water.  
2. An instance of #$Water-Ingestible #$isa #$Water (but may have trace constituents).
3. An instance of #$PoolWater #$isa #$Water (but has some #$Chlorine as a salient #$constituents). 
4. An instance of #$SeaWater #$isa #$Water (but has some #$Salt-NaCl as a salient #$constituents).  


#$mainConstituent - Use #$mainConstituent when X contains other substances besides water, would NOT commonly referred to as `water', and yet has MOST of the material properties of water.  As a rule, most of the properties of the #$mainConstituent transfer to the substance it's a part of.  Often such substances have at least one important and/or perceptible characteristic (due to admixture) that is quite different from the properties of water.  

Examples: 

1. An instance of #$Lemonade is NOT called `water' but has water as a #$mainConstituent.  It tastes quite different from water.  It has nutritional (caloric) value.  It is a human-made beverage.  
2. An instance of #$Coffee-Beverage is NOT called `water' but has water as a #$mainConstituent.  It tastes quite different from water.  It contains caffeine.  Also, a specific inference about coffee's (lack of) transparency should override the transparency which would otherwise be inferred from the material properties of its #$mainConstituent.  
3. Aqueous hydrochloric acid has many of the properties of its main constituent, water -- for example, transparency, viscosity, density, freezing point, etc.  But it also has the very important difference that it is highly acidic, caustic, etc. -- and attributing to it water's potability would be disastrous.

#$constituents - Use #$constituents when X is NOT commonly referred to as `water' and has FEW properties of water, even though X contains water.  

Examples:

1. An instance of (#$SolidFn #$Gelatin) is NOT called `water', and though it has water among its #$constituents, gelatin has very few of the properties of water. 
2. An instance of #$Concrete is NOT called `water'; though it has water among its #$constituents, it has none of the salient characteristics of water.
3. An instance  of #$Mud is NOT called `water' and has few characteristics of water, though water is among its #$constituents.  Its #$mainConstituent is some portion of #$Soil.")))

  (DOCUMENTATION "If one wishes
to state a fact M about an formula F, i.e. if one wishes to assert the
meta-assertion M(F) and if F canonicalizes into multiple assertions,
a_1, a_2...a_n, then one may have to do a non-standard procedure.  If
F canonicalizes into a_1, a_2...a_n *and* when any of a_1, a_2...a_n
uncanonicalize back into A then the meta assertion M(F) gets
automatically distributed to each of a_1, a_2...a_n.  In such a case
M(F) ends up in the knowledge base as several assertions, i.e. M(a_1),
M(a_2), ...  M(a_n).  In other cases (i.e. where a polycanonicalizing
formula does not uncanonicalize back into itself) (typically rarer),
one will have to do the non-standard procedure of distributing the
meta-assertions by hand.  

Example (of the more standard case):

(fi-assert
  '(#$implies (#$isa ?x #$Animal)
       (#$thereExists ?y 
         (#$and (#$isa ?y #$FemaleAnimal) (#$mother ?x ?y))))
  #$BaseKB)

produces in the two assertions:

#<AS:(#$implies (#$and (#$isa ?X #$Animal) (#$termOfUnit ?Y
        (#$SKF-16480338 ?X))) (#$mother ?X ?Y)):#$BaseKB>

#<AS:(#$implies (#$and (#$isa ?X #$Animal) (#$termOfUnit ?Y 
        (#$SKF-16480338 ?X))) (#$isa ?Y #$FemaleAnimal)):#$BaseKB>

Note that these two assertions share the common EL formula:
 (#$implies (#$isa ?x #$Animal)
    (#$thereExists ?y 
       (#$and (#$isa ?y #$FemaleAnimal) (#$mother ?x ?y))))

Now if we add a meta assertion that references this formula:

(fi-assert
  '(#$salientAssertions #$mother
       (#$implies (#$isa ?x #$Animal)
          (#$thereExists ?y (#$and (#$isa ?y #$FemaleAnimal) 
                                   (#$mother ?x ?y)))))
  #$BaseKB)

the meta formula automatically distributes over the two assertions:

#<AS:(#$salientAssertions #$mother 
        #<AS:(#$implies (#$and (#$isa ?X #$Animal) 
                               (#$termOfUnit ?Y (#$SKF-16480338 ?X)))
                        (#$mother ?X ?Y)):#$BaseKB):#$BaseKB>

#<AS(#$salientAssertions #$mother
       #<AS:(#$implies (#$and (#$isa ?X #$Animal)
                              (#$termOfUnit ?Y (#$SKF-16480338 ?X)))
                       (#$isa ?Y #$FemaleAnimal)):#$BaseKB):#$BaseKB>

be turned-off by setting the parameter

 (:ABOUT |NoteAboutSidedObject| |SharedNote|
  (DOCUMENTATION "We consider this concept to be a lynchpin in the CycL representation
of direction.  A #$BilateralObject is an object which is conventionally
considered to have either a top and a bottom, a front and a back, or a
left and a right.  These possibilities are each represented with a spec.

Here are some examples and some non-examples of members of this 
category.

A perfectly smooth ball bearing is usually (read on for exceptions) a
negative exemplar of a #$BilateralObject.  On the other hand a ball
bearing with a dot painted on one side, could be considered to have a
well-defined front if, for example, the dotted were designated as the
front side.

A typical water glass has a top and bottom and no left and right nor
front and back.  Thus it is strictly a #$BilateralObject and not a
#$HexalateralObject.

A javelin has a front and back and no left and right nor top and
bottom.  Thus it is strictly a #$BilateralObject, and not a
#$HexalateralObject.

Objects that typically move in some direction such as vehicles,
mammals, commets, or cars have their fronts and backs determined by
their typical direction of motion.

In #$ModernShelterConstructions, 'front' and 'back' are generally
determined by which side faces the street, and 'top' and 'bottom' by
which side 'normally' is in the air and which side 'normally' is 
on the ground.  From these four an intrinsic left and right can
also be established.

We do not distinguish very many objects in the everyday world that are
#$BilateralObjects with respect to left and right and not with respect
to anything else.  In most cases--including automobiles, houses, and
human beings--left and right exist solely because there is a
well-established top, bottom, front, and back.  This seems to be a
peculiarity of human psychology.

As regards #$TopAndBottomSidedObject, #$LeftAndRightSidedObject, and
#$FrontAndBackSidedObject, we should be VERY careful to include as specs of
these collections only types for which there are already
well-established conventions for distinguishing the sides in question.
It is probably the case that any instance of #$PartiallyTangible is
POTENTIALLY a #$HexalateralObject, or at least a #$BilateralObject of
some sort--i.e., we could invent conventions for distinguishing the
relevant sides.  The possibility of such invention is not a sufficient
condition for membership in any of the 'bilateral' collections.  For
example, in most microtheories, the collection of ball bearing should
not #$BilateralObject as a #$genls.

Here are some potentially misleading non-examples: 

Hourglass: no conventions regarding any sides 

Book: no clear-cut conventions regarding any sides--if it lies face-up
on the table the 'front' of the book may be the front cover; in a
bookcase, the 'front' may well be the spine.  In other words although
an object may have front, back, etc sides determined by considerations
extrinsic to the object (such as its relationship to the bookshelf)
#$HexalateralObjects have front, back, etc sides determined
*intrinsically*.

Desk: obvious convention for distinguishing top from bottom; no
convention for distinguishing front and back: it depends which side of
the desk you're on.  However, desks designed to be against a wall do
have clear front and back sides.

Note that mere assymetry does not  make something a #$BilateralObject.
Consider,  for  example,  a  nebula  or  a  crumpled  piece  of paper.
Although they are assymetric on all three  axis, they are not elements
of #$HexalateralObject  since no  conventions exist for distinguishing
an  intrinsic left, right, bottom,  top, front,  or back.  Conversely,
take  an  essentially   symmetrical object    like  an  aluminum  can.
Notwithstanding   its  overall   symmetry,   there  exist  established
conventions according  to which the side  on which it 'normally' rests
is its bottom  and  the side with  the  pulltab is its top.   Likewise
there are established conventions according to which the side with the
brand  name on it  is the 'front' and  the side opposite that side the
back, and with  the aid of these we  can distinguish an intrinsic left
and right for the can as well.

Note that any two axes determine the third.  Thus any object which is
both a #$LeftAndRightSidedObject and a #$FrontAndBackSidedObject is
also a #$TopAndBottomSidedObject.")))

exactly one free variable.

By definition, #$exceptFor is merely syntactic sugar:
  (#$exceptFor [term] Q(?x0)) 
  <=> 
  (#$exceptWhen (equals ?x0 [term]) Q(?x0))
Since an #$exceptWhen statement is a meta-statement about some rule 
Q(?x0 ... ?xn), the statement is not well-formed if Q(?x0 ... ?xn) is
not already an assertion in the KB.  Also, strictly speaking, P and Q in
the #$exceptWhen merely must share some variables rather than all
