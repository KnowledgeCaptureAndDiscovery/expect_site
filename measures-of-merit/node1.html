<P>
This document proposes a representation for <EM>measures of effect</EM>
(also called <EM>measures of merit</EM>) of objectives in air campaign
plans.<A NAME="tex2html1" HREF="footnode.html#154"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.isi.edu/~valente/images/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A> This
representation is based on discussions with CHECKMATE. More
specifically, its development is part of the ISI work in the
continuing development of INSPECT (INtelligent System for air campaign
Plans evaluation based on ExpeCT). INSPECT is a knowledge-based system
developed using ISI's EXPECT framework. The system checks the
consistency of air campaign plans with respect to several criteria.
INSPECT provides consistency checking for operational plans developed
(or modified) using ACPT. For a detailed description of INSPECT, see
[<A HREF="node8.html#Valente96a">Valente <EM>et al.</EM>, 1996a</A>].
<P>
The term <EM>measure of effect</EM> should not be confused with <EM>
  measure of effectiveness</EM>. The former, is a synonym for <EM>measure
  of merit</EM>, something that defines when an objective has been
achieved -- that is, how to measure the effect of an objective/task.
In contrast, a measure of effectiveness relates to the <EM>
  performance</EM> in a campaign, i.e. in executing an air campaign plan.
Typical measures of effectiveness refer to sortie rates, loss exchange
ratios, repair rates, etc. All these elements help defining how well
certain forces or units are performing in a campaign (but say nothing
about whether or not they are achieving their objectives).
<P>
The representation proposed in this document is a continuation of work
in the representation of objectives in air campaign plans, initially
documented in [<A HREF="node8.html#Valente96b">Valente <EM>et al.</EM>, 1996b</A>]. The basic idea is to provide a
richer and more structured representation for air campaign plan
objectives than the one currently used. It must be noted that we do
not make any attempt to define methodological guidelines regarding the
development of measures of effect, or what constitute ``good''
measures of effect. The proposed representation is basically
syntactical in character (even though it hints at the semantics of
MOEs).
<P>
This document assumes some familiarity with the air campaign planning
domain, and the tools currently used to support it, like ACPT and
INSPECT. Further, it assumes knowledge of the representation for ACP
objectives proposed in [<A HREF="node8.html#Valente96b">Valente <EM>et al.</EM>, 1996b</A>]. This document is structured
as follows. In Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node2.html#rationale">2</A> we briefly describe the
background and rationale for the proposed representation. In
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node3.html#repr">3</A> we present the representation, and show how a
number of examples of MOEs would be expressed using it.  In
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node4.html#issues">4</A> we discuss several issues raised in constructing
the representation, and how they have been solved through discussions
with Checkmate. In section&nbsp;<A HREF="node5.html#connection">5</A> we discuss briefly the
role measures of effect can play in connecting Intelligence and
Operation groups in air campaign planning. Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node6.html#loomspec">6</A>
contains the specification of the representation as a Loom ontology
(definitions).  Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node7.html#idlspec">7</A> contains the specification of an
IDL schema to store measures of effect using the structured
representation proposed here.

 This document is the result of many
discussions with Major Alred and Major Cunico, of Checkmate, who I
would like to thank very much for their invaluable and continuous help
and support. The views expressed here do not necessarily agree with
theirs; in particular, all mistakes are my sole responsibility.
