Although this document does not intend to set methodological
guidelines for creating measures of effect, we thought it would be
interesting to report on an important issue raised during the
discussions that led to the representation proposed here. In this
section, we will briefly discuss the potential role of measures of
effect in integrating Intelligence and Operation more closely in an
air campaign.
<P>
There is usually a sharp separation between Operations (OPS) and
Intelligence (INTEL) groups in air campaign planning. We propose that
measures of effect can be seen (and used) as a formal connective
element between the two groups. Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node5.html#figopsintel">3</A> pictures
the relationship. An <EM>air campaign objective</EM> is developed by OPS.
Its <EM>measure of effect</EM> specifies how to assess whether or not (or
to what extent) the objective has been achieved -- that is why it
must be measurable. The measure of effect is thus based on a <EM>
  measurable element</EM>. This measurable element is (or should be) used
in the INTEL side as a specification of what OPS needs to be measured
in order to assess the execution of the plan. For this end, INTEL
knows of several <EM>measurement methods</EM> to determine the current
value of a measurable element. As we can see, the connecting point
between OPS and INTEL is that <EM>in order to define how to assess an
  air campaign plan, OPS employs measurable elements that INTEL is
  supposed to actually measure during the campaign</EM>.

<P>
<P>
The important point here is that <EM>ideally</EM> the set of measurable
elements used by OPS should be the same one that INTEL has measurement
methods to effectively determine the value. We found out that there is
frequently a mismatch between these. For example, OPS may use a
measurable element like ``air superiority'', which is not directly
measurable and may force INTEL to further specify it in terms of more
detailed measurable elements (e.g. aircraft losses) that may or may
not match with what OPS intended. The other way around, OPS often does
not make use of all the possibilities know to INTEL in terms of
measurable elements, because it does not know about it. Finally,
sometimes one measurable element may be much more easy or cheap to
measure than another, and it would help in reducing the cost and
improving the effectiveness of campaigns if this was known to OPS at
the moment it specifies the measures of effect. The result is that
INTEL is not able to measure the plan specified by OPS, has difficulty
with measuring it, or does it in a sub-optimal manner. The
consequences for the campaign effectiveness and efficiency can be very
serious.
<P>
Therefore, we believe it would be strongly beneficial to define, as
formally as possible, a set of ``standard'' measurable elements which
is agreed upon by INTEL and OPS. This set should be based initially on
INTEL's capability, that is, it should define what INTEL has methods
to measure. Further, it could work as an instrument in which OPS can
suggest INTEL to develop techniques and methods for measuring elements
it cannot measure currently. It can also contain preferences
indicating which elements are easier or cheaper to measure,a nd should
be preferred over other elements if possible. Finally, these
``standard'' measurable elements can help defining what is the ideal
level of abstraction for the measurable elements (so that they are
neither too vague nor overly specific), and, most importantly, to
specify what is the <EM>intended meaning</EM> of the measurable elements.
