 <H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">4 Some Issues and Design Decisions</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="issues">&#160;</A>
<P>
Several issues were raised by the analysis of the set of examples of
measures of effect available to the author. Because their solution
implied design decisions in the representation which should be
documented, in the following sections we will present these issues and
discuss how they were solved.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00041000000000000000">4.1 MOEs about forcing enemy actions</A></H2>
<P>
In the examples of MOEs we have available, one rather different type
of MOE is the one that states that the enemy is forced to do something
-- generally use a back-up or secondary system. The following are the
examples found in the IFD-4 scenario plan:
<P>

<PRE>Force use of more vulnerable back-up modes of comm
Force erroneous decision due to mis-information
Force use of back-up information transfer systems
Force use of more vulnerable transmission systems
Force collections via back-up modes
Force use of back-up modes of comm
Force use of back-up comm nodes</PRE>

<P>
While this looks like a reasonable way to measure the effectiveness of
an objective/task, several questions remain in our view.  These MOEs
can have (at least) two meanings. Let's take the first MOE in the list
above as an example. The first meaning for it is that the original
(non back-up) systems were enough destroyed that cannot be used
anymore.  The second meaning is that the back-up systems were used --
perhaps only once.  (A third meaning is: both of the above). The
difference may be crucial from the point of view of INTEL. For
example, it may be that the backup systems are being used <EM>
  together</EM> with (part of) the main systems. A situation like this
looks like it would fit the MOE, but is it really what is meant? Or is
it meant, for example, that back-up systems are being used
exclusively, or perhaps only more than main systems?
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00041010000000000000">Decision</A></H4>
<P>
It was decided that these objectives are going to be reformulated to
fit in to the present representation, because they are imprecise. The
design decision was not to change the representation in order to
accommodate a new format of MOEs.
<P>
Some of the MOEs of this type will be made into objectives, for
example the MOE ``Force erroneous decision due to mis-information''.
Others will probably be expressed in terms of a reduction in the
number of main (non back-up) equipment/systems/modes and/or the number
of back-up equipment/systems/nodes used as an effect of the objective.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00042000000000000000">4.2 Measures of Effect that Specify Other Objectives</A></H2>
<P>
MOEs may contain what looks like the specification of another
objective or task subordinated to the original objective. The example
from IFD-4 is:
<P>
<PRE>Objective: Support GCC scheme of maneuver
      MOE: Prep the Battlefield for Future Friendly Operations</PRE>
<P>
This case seems to be relatively clear cut; we don't see how this can
be considered as measuring whether GCC's scheme of maneuver was
supported, but rather saying what tasks (lower-level objectives) are
to be done to accomplish it. The other MOE for this objective (Use CAS
to Enable Friendly Ground Scheme of Maneuver) seems to support this
interpretation, since it also looks a bit like a task by itself --
notice the ``enable'' verb used. In this case, CAS may be in reality a
means not to accomplish the air objective ``Support GCC scheme of
maneuver'', but the implicit air task ``Enable Friendly Ground Scheme
of Maneuver''.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00042010000000000000">Solution</A></H4>
<P>
This MOE is indeed an objective. The design decision is not to alter
the representation to accommodate this case.
<P>
Remaining related questions:
<P>
<UL><LI> If we look as the second MOE as also hiding an objective, this
  objective would be ``Enable Friendly Ground Scheme of Maneuver''.
  How is that different from the parent ``Support GCC scheme of
  maneuver''?<LI> Again the problem came up in an objective nominated by another
  component command.
</UL><H2><A NAME="SECTION00043000000000000000">4.3 Verbs used in MOEs</A></H2>
<P>
In the list of example, five verbs were used: <EM>reduce, degrade,
  decrease, limit</EM> and <EM>delay</EM>. While <EM>delay</EM> has clearly a
different meaning, the other four verbs seem to be used in the same
sense, which is to lower the value of something. Further, <EM>limit</EM>
was used in only one MOE: ``Limit ability for troop movement on
primary LOCs by 35%''. Are these verbs really different when used in
MOEs? Would it be a viable option to simplify the grammar to adopt
only one or a few of them?
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00043010000000000000">Solution</A></H4>
<P>
It was decided to limit the set of verbs to two: <EM>reduce</EM> and <EM>
  degrade</EM>. Reduce is usually used in connection with a capability,
while degrade usually refers to an action. However, this usage will
not be enforced by the representation. The two remaining verbs are
eliminated, and their appearances are going to be substituted by <EM>
  reduce</EM>. The design decision is not to include the two verbs (<EM>
  limit</EM> and <EM>decrease</EM>) in the grammar.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00044000000000000000">4.4 Break the MOE in two parts</A></H2>
<P>
Current MOEs are written as a single sentence. However, one of the
consequences is that the quantification may be scattered around the
phrase, e.g., ``<EM>Degrade</EM> NCA Communications links <EM>by
  50%</EM>''. It would be better to keep these elements together, making
the MOE less a sentence and more a structure. For instance, the MOE
above would be written ``NCA Communications links -- Degrade by
50%''.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00044010000000000000">Solution</A></H4>
<P>
It was decided to break in two parts instead of keeping it as a single
English sentence. This format has already been used in exercises by
Major Alred, and it seems to yield good results.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00045000000000000000">4.5 The tense of the verbs</A></H2>
<P>
In current MOEs, the verbs are usually in the present tense. This is
somewhat a consequence of the fact that they are written before the
campaign, when the objectives are going to be achieved in the future.
However, particularly when putting the verb in the end as in the
format proposed, it may be better to use a language that describes a
<EM>state</EM> instead of a <EM>goal</EM>.  For instance, to write
``decrease by 30%'' has a strong flavor of an objective, while
``decreased by 30%'' indicates the effect of achieving the objective,
that is, a state in which the objective has been achieved. Further,
the fact that verbs (degrade, limit, etc.) are being use can raise the
suspicion that the MOEs that use them are in fact objectives in
disguise. However, we believe that they are just a different way to
phrase the effect. For example, one can read ``Degrade NCA
Communications links by 50%'' as ``NCA Communications links degraded
by 50%''.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00045010000000000000">Solution</A></H4>
<P>
The form adopted for the verbs was the past tense. It helps avoiding
the confusion of objectives and MOEs (which can be caused if they use
similar sentence forms with verbs in the imperative form).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00046000000000000000">4.6 No, None, Zero</A></H2>
<P>
Frequently, ``No'' is used in the examples of MOE available to mean
the value zero in some countable quantification. For example. ``No
loss of Allied Aircraft to Libyan surface or air forces'' means that
the event ``loss of Allied Aircraft to Libyan surface or air''
(measurable element) should occur zero times (quantification). Is this
the correct interpretation?
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00046010000000000000">Solution</A></H4>
<P>
It was adopted to allow either ``Zero'' or ``None'' as a possible
value. ``No'' was not used because of it does not read well in the
structure adopted for the MOE (two parts instead of one sentence).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00047000000000000000">4.7 Specifying Means in Measures of Effect</A></H2>
<P>
We have found that several MOEs contain a direct or indirect
specification of the means the planner wishes to use in accomplishing
the objective. Indeed, sometimes the MOE contains a disguised form of
such specification, with no actual measurement of when we can
consider the objective achieved. Consider the following examples,
from the plan used in the IFD-4:
<P>
<PRE>Use PSYOPS techniques
Use CAS to Enable Friendly Ground Scheme of Maneuver
Exploit SOF Intelligence
Exploit SOF Targeting Inputs
Use of CAS to enable ground scheme of maneuver</PRE>
<P>
These MOEs do not define a way to measure the accomplishment or
progress in the execution of the objective. Instead, they define an
additional piece of the objective, which is the definition of <EM>
  how</EM> -- that is, by which means -- is the objective to be
accomplished. This information currently has no adequate place to go,
which is likely to be the reason why they ended up in the measures of
effect.
<P>
It is interesting to notice that the examples above refer to either a
special asset or method (PSYOPS, Special forces) or a type of
operation that is seen as a whole to be an asset by itself (combat air
support, CAS). The examples do not refer to the ``usual'' assets, like
aircraft or traditional weapons. We suppose this occurs because it is
always assumed the objectives (which in the case are all force
application objectives) will employ aircraft and related weapons. The
need to specify that, say, an objective is to be accomplished using
PSYOPS seems to appear because the assumed default was not valid.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00047010000000000000">Solution</A></H4>
<P>
We will add a new slot to the specification of air campaign objectives
(NOT to the measures of merit). This slot, called SPECIAL
MEANS,<A NAME="tex2html6" HREF="footnode.html#107"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.isi.edu/~valente/images/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>
is optional, and filled by one or more of a small number of fillers
that represent non-traditional force application means.  Known fillers
are: <I>SOF</I> (which is the same as <I>special forces</I> or <I>
  special operation forces</I>), <I>SOF Intelligence</I>, <I>SOF
  Targeting Inputs</I>, <I>CAS</I>, and <I>PSYOPS</I>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00048000000000000000">4.8 Measures of Effect or Efficiency?</A></H2>
<P>
Consider the following objective and its measure of effect:
<P>
<PRE>Objective: Destroy fleeting targets
      MOE: Strike Targets Designated by unconventional forces within 12 hours</PRE>
<P>
The first question is, is the objective above accomplished if its MOE
is true (that is, if targets are indeed struck within 12 hours)? Or is
this just a measure of the <EM>efficiency</EM> with which the objective
is accomplished? In one case the measure of merit determine what it
means for the objective to be accomplished. In the other, it
determines how well (how fast, how precisely, etc.) it should be
accomplished.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00048010000000000000">Solution</A></H4>
<P>
It is important to represent measures of efficiency, but these are
really different from MOEs. The example is more a guidance than a
measure of effect or effectiveness, and should be restated or
eliminated. A possible rephrasing in a genuine MOE could be
``Nominated targets -- Reduce by 90%''.
<P>
In a related issue, many of these examples come from objectives that
were nominated from other forces, and about which not much is known at
planning time. Checkmate proposed that a good practice with respect to
these objectives is to either find the missing information and define
specific tasks for them, or not to decompose them altogether. An
attempt to decompose these objectives into tasks without proper
detailed knowledge can lead to problems such as the ones we pointed
out in the measures of effect.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00049000000000000000">4.9 MOEs that are states</A></H2>
<P>
Consider the following MOEs:
<P>

<PRE>Mediterranean remain free for commercial shipping
Freedom of air movement over the battlespace</PRE>

<P>
These MOEs represent states directly, that is, they mean that the
effect of the objective is that (taking the second MOE as an example)
there is freedom of movement in the battlespace. The problem with
these definitions is that states are not measured very easily, at
least not directly. For instance, what exactly is meant by ``freedom''
in the second MOE? Is it enough that there is no engagement, or is it
necessary that these engagements do not represent a real threat (e.g.,
because they are not coordinated)? It seems that while the state
``freedom of air movement'' accurately describes the effect intended
by the objective it is attached to, it is not really measurable. It
would be more reasonable to establish quantified (indirect) measures
of what this freedom is, e.g., ``no engagement during day time''.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00049010000000000000">Solution</A></H4>
<P>
These are indeed effects, not measures of effect. These objectives can
and should be rephrased into the proposed representation, in terms of
measurable elements.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION000410000000000000000">4.10 Reference values</A></H2>
<P>
Frequently, the MOE omits the reference value, such as in ``Degrade
NCA Communications links by 50%''. In other words, it is not clear
(or at least explicit) which is the initial value of the NCA
communication links that is the basis of comparison for the 50%.
However, this may be clear in the context if we assume that the basis
of comparison is the value at the beginning of the conflict. The
question is, should we enforce an initial value or not? An option to
make this more palatable is to assume a default value such as
``pre-conflict levels''.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION000410010000000000000">Solution</A></H4>
<P>
It was adopted the option of using a default value ``pre-conflict
levels'', and further, allow the specification of reference values in
terms of a date: ``known by <I>date</I>'', or ``current as of <I>
  date</I>''. The default for <I>date</I> will be the date in which the
plan is produced.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION000411000000000000000">4.11 Value Restrictions</A></H2>
<P>
All the MOEs we have found use a specific value, mostly Zero (the same
thing as ``No''), like in ``No Libyan aircraft deliver weapons against
allied forces''.  However, it can be an interesting idea to use a
value restriction (minimum/at least, maximum/at-most), like: ``At most
three weapons deliveries by aircraft against allied forces'' or ``At
most 10% reduction of Friendly shipping due to Enemy naval vessels''.
While I can easily understand why in most of the cases the value is
Zero, objectives with restrictions instead of hard values may be more
realistic.  For example, it may be the case that an objective did not
fail after all only because there was one single ``loss of friendly
air forces''?  In other words, it makes sense to use hard limits
sometimes, but the option of using a more flexible definition can be
attractive too.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION000411010000000000000">Solution</A></H4>
<P>
It was adopted the option of specifying MOE quantifications with value
restrictions (<I>at most</I>, <I>at least</I>).
