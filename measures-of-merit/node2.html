<H4><A NAME="SECTION00020010000000000000">How the representation was built</A></H4>
<P>
The representation proposed here has been built using a ``bottom-up''
process. We used a set of measures of effect used by CHECKMATE in the
scenario plan in IFD-4 as well as previous plans developed during the
knowledge acquisition process in building INSPECT. We abstracted an
initial set of elements and some common patterns in that set, and then
refined these by interviewing CHECKMATE experts.
<P>
Measures of effect are one slot of the current representation of ACP
objectives used in ACPT. It is currently filled by a string. A measure
of effect, as the name says, provides a way to measure whether or not
(or to what extent) an objective has been achieved. One of the
important considerations in developing measures of effect is that they
are to be interpreted and operationalized by Intelligence personnel,
who are responsible for obtaining the information necessary to
actually measure them in the execution of a plan.

<P>
The main goals of the proposed representation are the following:
<P>
<UL><LI> To enrich and correct the representation presently used in order
  to enable automated reasoning (in some degree) about measures of
  effect.<LI> To support error checking during the editing of objectives.<LI> To serve as a focal-point to think about the use of measures of
  effect of objectives in air campaign planning. For instance, to
  discuss a representation for measures of effect as proposed here
  raises several methodological issues which are important even
  outside the realm of making systems for supporting air campaign
  planning.
