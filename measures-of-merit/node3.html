<A NAME="repr">&#160;</A>
<P>
In this section, we present the proposed representation for measures
of effect. First, we distinguish some types of MOEs, and then we
present a grammar for their representation in Backus-Naur Form (BNF).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00031000000000000000">3.1 Basic Elements</A></H2>
<P>
In the specification of a measure of effect, two basic elements can be
distinguished: a <EM>measurable element</EM> and its <EM>
  quantification</EM>:<A NAME="tex2html2" HREF="footnode.html#37"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.isi.edu/~valente/images/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
<UL><LI> The <EM>measurable element</EM> can be anything that can be
  measured in the domain, ranging from some of the enemy's
  capabilities to the occurrence of some actions. We have found the
  following types of measurable elements in the set of examples we
  examined:
  <UL><LI> A <EM>capability</EM>, for example ``ability for troop movement
    on primary LOCs'' or ``petroleum production capability''.<LI> An <EM>object</EM> or type of object or system, for example ``NCA
    Communications links'' or ``WMD Facilities''.<LI> An <EM>event</EM>, for instance, ``Libyan aircraft deliver
    weapons against allied forces'' or ``loss of allied shipping to
    Libyan surface or sub-surface vessels''.<LI> An <EM>aspect</EM> of some objects/systems/area in the domain,
    for example, ``Mediterranean free for commercial shipping'' or
    ``communication effectiveness''..
  </UL>
<P>
  The interesting aspect of the measurable elements is (as the name
  indicates) that they should be measurable. This produces the
  interesting effect that the actions that are used as measurable
  elements must be countable, and in fact used as events.
<P>
  It happens frequently that the measurable element is forgotten,
  generating MOEs like ``Degrade by 50%''. In these cases, the idea is
  that the measurable element is implicit in the objective. For
  example, for an objective like ``Disrupt petroleum production
  capability'', what this MOE means is ``Degrade petroleum production
  capability by 50%''. In the new representation, this reference
  cannot be left implicit. However, an editor for MOEs can offer the
  same object used in the objective as the element to be measured in
  the MOE, thereby facilitating edition.<LI> The <EM>quantification</EM> is expressed as either a countable
  value (usually a number) or a change (reduction or increase, usually
  in percentage) in the value from a reference value (usually the
  value at the beginning of the conflict). Examples of quantification
  are: ``Degrade by 50%'' and ``Reduce to 20% of pre-conflict
  levels''.
<P>
</UL><H2><A NAME="SECTION00032000000000000000">3.2 BNF Specification of the Grammar</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="bnf">&#160;</A>
<P>
The specification in this section is made only for the main type of
MOEs defined above; the ``force'' examples are to be dealt with
later.
<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node3.html#figbnf">1</A> shows a specification of the representation as a
grammar in BNF (Backus-Naur Form).  Terms in all capitals are reserved
terms (keywords).  Lowercase terms are non-terminal. Terms with first
letter in capitals represent names or strings, that is, they are
currently ``free text'' fields.<A NAME="tex2html5" HREF="footnode.html#51"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.isi.edu/~valente/images/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>
Options are indicated as <I>A | B</I>, meaning either <I>A</I> or <I>
  B</I> (but not both). Parentheses specify scope.  Elements within
brackets are optional. <I>A+</I> indicates one or more occurrences of
<I>A</I>, <I>A*</I> indicates zero or more occurrences of <I>A</I>.

<P>
In order to help the visualization and understanding of this grammar
(and considering that not everybody is well-acquainted with a BNF
form), Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node3.html#figmoegrammar">2</A> shows the main elements of the
structured representation of measures of effect as a part-of
decomposition.

<P>
The following are examples of how some measures of effect can be
represented in the proposed grammar. Some of them are paraphrased from
the set of examples. The measurable element and the quantification are
separated for clarity.
