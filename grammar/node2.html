 <H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">2 A Representation for Air Campaign Plan Objectives</A></H1>
<P>
The proposed representation for air campaign plan objectives is
basically an extension of the present representation used in ACPT. The
main goals of the proposed representation:
<P>
<UL><LI> To enrich and correct the representation presently used in order
  to enable automated reasoning (in some degree) about objectives.<LI> To support error checking during the editing of objectives.<LI> To serve as a focal-point to think about the elements of
  objectives in air campaign planning and their representation. For
  instance, to discuss a representation for objectives as proposed
  here raises several methodological issues which are important even
  outside the realm of making systems for supporting air campaign
  planning.
</UL>
<P>
ACPT currently distinguishes the following components of an
objective:
<P>
<DL ><DT><STRONG>title</STRONG>
<DD> This is a textual description of the objective, for
  example, <I>Disrupt SAM sites in the Changjon region</I>. 
<DT><STRONG>measures of merit</STRONG>
<DD> This field contains one or more descriptions
  of success criteria for the objective, for instance, <I>
    Uncoordinated and delayed Red air attacks</I>.
<DT><STRONG>action</STRONG>
<DD> This is a verb, chosen from a menu. There are currently
  four actions: <I>Attack, Defend, Jam</I> and <I>Monitor</I>.
<DT><STRONG>effect</STRONG>
<DD> This is also a verb from a menu with the following
  choices: <I>Destroy, Attrit, Disrupt</I> and <I>Influence</I>.
<DT><STRONG>location</STRONG>
<DD> This is filled (with text) from a list of locations
  set in ACPT for the scenario or theater at hand.
<DT><STRONG>% complete</STRONG>
<DD> A slider allows the user to specify a number
  between 0 and 100.
<DT><STRONG>review status</STRONG>
<DD> This may be either <I>Default, Reviewed</I> or
  <I>Changed</I>. 
<DT><STRONG>parents</STRONG>
<DD> This field contains a list of objectives at a higher
  level to which the current objective is to be considered a child. It
  is usually filled by selecting one (previously edited) such higher
  objective.
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
The representation proposed in this document extends the above
representation in order to address two main problems. First, it
proposes a more detailed and structured representation for the
<em>Title</em> field, that also makes superfluous the fields
<em>Effect</em> and <em>Action</em>. Second, it proposes a new field
<em>Sequence restrictions</em>, that clears up a difference between
prioritization and sequencing which is currently not made and which
(according to CHECKMATE) has caused considerable confusion among ACPT
users.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00021000000000000000">2.1 Structuring the <EM>Title</EM></A></H2>
<P>
The <EM>Title</EM> field actually contains a statement or specification
of the objective -- for instance, <I>Disrupt SAM sites in the
  Western region</I>. This is presently a free text field in ACPT. The
<em>action</em> field and <em>effect</em> fields hint at specifying the
desired effect and action types. However, they fall short of
specifying the objective in adequate richness of detail.  Further,
they are filled from a menu of options which is currently extremely
minimal and consequently poor.
<P>
The proposed representation provides structure to what is currently
the <em>title</em>, decomposing it as follows:
<P>
<DL ><DT><STRONG>action type</STRONG>
<DD> This is a verb or verb expression, such as <I>
    Destroy</I>, <I>Disrupt</I>, <I>Deny use</I>.
<DT><STRONG>action roles</STRONG>
<DD> These are descriptions of the objects the action
  type refers to, in terms of pairs of <em>role name</em> and
  <em>action object</em>:
  <DL ><DT><STRONG>role names</STRONG>
<DD> are either a preposition (<I>to</I>, <I>from</I>,
    <I>over</I>) or DOB (symbolyzing the direct object).
  <DT><STRONG>role objects</STRONG>
<DD> belong to four basic types:
    <UL><LI> <em>actions</em> or <em>activities</em> such as <I>production
        of chemical products</I> or <I>artillery fire in Changjon
        region</I>.<LI> <em>action capabilities</em> such as <I>radio transmission
        capability</I> or <I>ability to conduct ofensive operations</I>.<LI> <em>objects</em> such as <I>key command centers</I>, <I>SAM
        radars</I> or <I>electrical power grid</I>.<LI> <em>aspects</em> such as <I>freedom of navigation</I> or <I>
        air superiority</I>.<LI> <em>areas</em> There is only one known example of a goal that
      uses an area (or location) as an object, which is <I>Drive Red
        into desired chokepoints and restricted LOCs</I>.
    </UL>
    Action objects may also specify who controls or owns the action
    object (e.g. <I>air superiority OF Blue</I> or <I>production of
      chemical products OF Red</I>). In more complex descriptions, they
    may use time and space modifiers similar to the ones used to
    qualify the whole objective (see below).
<P>
 </DL>
<DT><STRONG>modifiers</STRONG>
<DD> specify time and space restrictions on the objective,
  for instance <I>within 21 days</I>, or <I>in Western Black Sea</I>. In
  other words, they specify the ``when'' and ``where'' of the
  objective as a whole.
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
This structure is inspired in <em>case grammars</em>. The basic idea of
case grammars is that there is normally a limited number of roles
(called <em>thematic</em> or <em>case</em> roles) that an argument of a
verb can play with relation to the verb. While case grammars have been
dismissed as a general solution for natural language interpretation,
they can be an interesting and powerful device in restricted settings
such as the one we have in the air campaign planning domain.
<P>
The proposed structured representation eliminates the fields <EM>
  action</EM>, <EM>effect</EM> and <EM>location</EM> of the current ACPT
representation.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00022000000000000000">2.2 Distinguishing Sequence from Priority</A></H2>
<P>
ACPT allows the specification of the relative priorities of
objectives, which are inherited by their children. If Air Objective O1
has priority over Air Objective O2, the Air Tasks which are specified
as their children will also obey that order, i.e. all tasks children
of O1 have a higher priority over all tasks children of O2. The
priorities may be overridden when the level of targets is reached,
i.e. the user may reprioritize any target at his/her will.
<P>
While this mechanism has been useful, interviews with CHECKMATE have
revealed that users often confuse priority with sequence. In general,
the fact that objective O1 has a higher priority than O2 does
<em>not</em> mean that it should be executed first. Indeed, if O2 is an
objective whose effect is a prerequisite for executing O1, O2 is the
one that should be executed first.
<P>
We believe that one of the reasons why this confusion exists is
because users are currently not allowed to specify that an objective
is to be accomplished before (or after, or at the same time than)
another. Therefore, we propose to introduce a new field <em>Sequence
  restrictions</em>, where the user can specify (if known) which objectives
are to be accomplished before/after/simultaneous with
others.<A NAME="tex2html2" HREF="footnode.html#79"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.isi.edu/~valente/images/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
Further, we have noticed that it is frequently difficult for air
campaign planners to make definite sequencing commitments. These
commitments have some gradation: sometimes one objective must be
accomplished before another is to be pursued, while in other cases it
is better but not strictly obligatory to do so. For this reason, we
have specified that the three basic sequence relations (<I>before</I>,
<I>after</I> and <I>simultaneous with</I> can be modified by one of the
following: <I>must, better, better not, must not</I>.  These modifiers
specify the ``hardness'' or ``certainty'' of the sequence restriction,
i.e.  how serious they should be taken in the actual sequencing of the
objectives and activities later on.
