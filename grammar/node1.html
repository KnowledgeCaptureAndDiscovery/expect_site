This document proposes a representation for objectives<A NAME="tex2html1" HREF="footnode.html#206"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.isi.edu/~valente/images/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A> This representation is based on
discussions with CHECKMATE, and was developed for use in IFD-4.  More
specifically, its development is part of the ISI work in developing
INSPECT (INtelligent System for air campaign Plans evaluation based on
ExpeCT). INSPECT is a knowledge-based system developed using ISI's
EXPECT framework. The system checks the consistency of air campaign
plans with respect to several criteria.  INSPECT provides consistency
checking for operational plans developed (or modified) using ACPT. For
a detailed description of INSPECT, see [<A HREF="node5.html#Valente96a">Valente <EM>et al.</EM>, 1996</A>].
<P>
The representation proposed in this document has as its main focus
providing a richer and more structured representation for air campaign
plan objectives than the one that is present in ACPT at the moment,
specifically as needed by INSPECT and the other IFD-4 systems.
However, since it has been submitted to a detailed validation process
with the experts in CHECKMATE, it may be used by other groups within
the initiative. It must be noted, however, that the work presented
here is still in progress, and this document should not be seen as
final or officially approved.
<P>
In addition to a representation for objectives, this document proposes
a library of objectives. More precisely, the elements of this library
are <em>templates</em> for the specification of the central part of the
objectives, namely their action (or activity) descriptions. The
templates make use of the structure defined in the proposed
representation for objectives. They can provide a basis for a
structured objectives editor in ACPT, that enforces to some extent the
correctness of the specification of objectives. They also provide a
set of coherent (and hopefully sufficient) elements to construct
objectives, and thus it is complementary to current work in the
initiative about plan ontologies and air campaign planning ontologies.
Specifically, the work presented in this document can be used as an
input to an ontology of the air campaign planning domain.
<P>
Both grammar and library have been built using a ``bottom-up''
process. We departed from a set of prototypical examples of objectives
proposed by CHECKMATE. We abstracted an initial set of elements and
some common patterns in that set, and then refined these by
interviewing CHECKMATE experts. The coverage of the library is
mostly limited to force application objectives -- a consequence of
the set of examples we departed from. However, this coverage can be
extended if necessary in the future.
<P>
The representation of objectives and the library of objetive templates
propose here is an intermediary solution between providing the ACPT
user with a set of predefined examples of objectives and leaving the
user free to write whatever seems to work. CHECKMATE has expressed
preference for the approach adopted here.

Knowledge acquisition was a critical task in building this grammar,
and demanded much effort from the experts. Many thanks to all
Checkmate members who interacted with us, and most especially to
Colonel Plebanek, who allowed us to have this interaction, Major
Cardenas, for coordinating the knowledge acquisition sessions, and to
the Checkmate members we used as experts and worked with closely:
Major Allison (``Coach''), Major Cardenas, Major Cunico, and Major
Jackson (``J.J.''). Special thanks to Major Alred (``Yogi''), who was
the major expert in the construction of this representation. Their
support to our work and their patience in answering our questions has
been vital to this effort. We hope they like the results.
