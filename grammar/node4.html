<P>
In the contact with the CHECKMATE experts, it became clear only
certain verbs are actually used as action types. Further, some may be
used but are not recommended (e.g. <I>conduct</I>). Thus, it is
possible to list the recommended verbs so as to create a library of
them, which can be made available to the user when s/he is specifying
an objective.
<P>
The number of verbs used in practice seems surprisingly small: not
more than 30 verbs have been used in the examples we got from
CHECKMATE. This is due in part to the fact that objectives in air
campaign planning in ACPT are actually <em>force application</em>
objectives, and thus several other types of actions related to
logistics, intelligence, etc. are not used. If ACPT is used to plan
these other aspects then more verbs would have to be introduced.
<P>
Further, each of these actions carries limitations with respect to the
types of action objects that can be used. For instance, all known
occurrences of the action type <I>establish</I> refer to an
<em>aspect</em> -- indeed, most of the times this aspect is <I>air
  superiority</I> or <I>air supremacy</I>. Further, all actions admit only
very few action roles, most of them only the direct object. This
indicates that, more than a list of verbs or action types, it is
possible to provide a library of <em>action templates</em>: an action
type plus one or more pairs role/object type.
<P>
The proposed library of action templates is listed below. The direct
object is indicated as DOB. Action roles that admit more than one type
of filler have them indicated as <I>A | B</I>. For example, a role
DOB with filler <I>action | aspect</I> allow either an action or an
aspect as their role object.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00041000000000000000">4.1 Some Issues about the Library</A></H2>
<P>
In this section, we discuss some issues on the choice of the elements
that were included or not included in the library, and the modelling
decisions behind these choices.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00041010000000000000">Templates versus examples</A></H4>
<P>
This library does not contain ready-made objectives or examples of
objectives, but according to CHECKMATE this is a feature rather than
a bug: ready-made objectives can make the users (particularly less
experienced ones) lazy in composing their own objectives. A library of
templates imposes a structure but leaves open several elements of the
objective to be filled by the user. This is particularly important in
training contexts, when the user might be interested to know what
types of objectives s/he may write but must be led to think about the
problem instead of accepting a ready-made solution. Another advantage
of a library such as this is that it helps to maintain some degree of
consistency and uniformity in writing the objectives, thus improving
communication and reducing the chances of any misunderstandings.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00041020000000000000">Action Verbs that Were Not Included</A></H4>
<P>
Many verbs have been proposed to be included in the library but were
discarded for specific reasons:
<P>
<DL ><DT><STRONG>vague verbs</STRONG>
<DD> These are:
  <UL><LI> <I>Provide for</I><LI> <I>Conduct</I><LI> <I>Execute</I><LI> <I>Employ</I><LI> <I>Build</I><LI> <I>Attack</I>
  </UL>
<P>
  These verbs are not specific enough to be used in the levels of CINC
  Objectives and below (though they may be used in the levels above,
  e.g. National Objectives).
<P>
<DT><STRONG>verbs that have a better substitute</STRONG>
<DD> Some verbs or verb
  expressions are commonly used but may have substitutes that convey
  with more clarity their meaning:
  <UL><LI> <I>Deny access</I> is substituted by <I>Isolate</I><LI> <I>Interrupt the flow of something</I> is substituted by <I>
      Disrupt OBJ the flow of something ON medium</I><LI> <I>Render ineffective</I> is substituted by either <I>
      Disrupt</I> or <I>Isolate</I>, depending on the context.<LI> <I>Establish</I> is substituted by <I>Gain</I> if the object is
    air superiority. 
  </UL> 
 </DL><H4><A NAME="SECTION00041030000000000000">Conjunctions of Action Verbs</A></H4>
<P>
There are several occurences in practice of objectives with two action
verbs in conjunction. The two most frequent examples are <I>Gain and
  Maintain</I> and <I>Isolate and Neutralize</I>. CHECKMATE experts have
pointed out that this is common practice (culture) in the air force,
but it is in fact wrong, since these verbs actually refer to rather
different processes. For instance, different types of force and
different tasks are necessary to gain air superiority and to maintain
it once it has been gained. Therefore, the library does not contain
these conjunctions, and they are not allowed in the grammar either. Of
course, the user may still want to employ these in the free text
description of the objectives.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00041040000000000000">A Typology of Action Verbs</A></H4>
<P>
The following is a first draft of a typology of action verbs prepared
based on (i) the division of action verbs in groups drawn by the types
of action objects they use (aspect, object, action capability, etc.)
and (ii) a number of distinctions proposed by CHECKMATE experts. The
first principle leads to a division in four basic groups: <EM>
  aspect-related</EM>, <EM>capability-related</EM>, <EM>action-related</EM> and
<EM>object-related</EM>. The second principle defines four subtypes of
<EM>object-related</EM> action verbs: <EM>denial</EM>, <EM>disconnection</EM>
(or <EM>separation</EM>), <EM>protection</EM> and <EM>physical
  destruction</EM>. The typology is pictured in a tree-like form in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node4.html#figactionverbs">2</A>.
<P>
This typology is not a taxonomy (where alternatives are mutually
exclusive) -- that is, certain action verbs fit in more than one
place.  Two verbs presently don't fit in any category: <I>Deceive</I>
and <I>Drive</I>. They may be assigned to categories of their own, but
a final decision depends on CHECKMATE's advice. The set of types is
not definitive, and more types/sub-types may be proposed.
