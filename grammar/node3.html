<P>
This section contains a specification of the grammar in BNF
(Backus-Naur Form).  Terms in all capitals are reserved terms
(keywords).  Lowercase terms are non-terminal. Terms with first letter
in capitals represent names or strings, that is, they are currently
``free text'' fields.<A NAME="tex2html4" HREF="footnode.html#85"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.isi.edu/~valente/images/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A> Options are
indicated as <I>A | B</I>, meaning either <I>A</I> or <I>B</I> (but not
both). Parentheses specify scope.  Elements within brackets are
optional. <I>A+</I> indicates one or more occurrences of <I>A</I>, <I>
  A*</I> indicates zero or more occurrences of <I>A</I>.
<P>
In order to help the visualization and understanding of this grammar
(and considering that not everybody is well-acquainted with a BNF
form), Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node3.html#figstrucgrammar">1</A> shows the main elements of the
grammar as a part-of decomposition. Some elements are ommited or
simplified for clarity.

<P>
<OL><LI> <I>Air Activities</I>, one level below <I>Air Tasks</I>, are
  presently not incorporated into ACPT, and its introduction in the
  grammar is due to CHECKMATE's suggestion. The idea is to
  distinguish an objective that involves a target from the target
  itself, thus allowing e.g. the representation of support missions.
  <I>Air Missions</I> were tentatively included at SRI's request,
  representing a special type of <I>Air Activity</I> that is generally
  fulfilled by a group of homogenous aircraft. Further interaction
  with CHECKMATE will verify if this additional level is necessary
  and if it requires special representation.<LI> DOB indicates the direct object. In practice, an interface that
  produces a human readable version of an objective migt prefer to
  ommit this token, which is necessary only for machine parsing
  purposes.<LI> Objectives are defined in such a way that the user can specify
  the action of the objective with a a structured definition (via the
  <TT>structured-action-spec</TT>), with a free text definition (via the
  <TT>text-action-spec</TT>) or both. This is intentional, as a way to
  preserve the ability of the users to define objectives beyond the
  limits of the defined grammar. It also preserves some level of
  compatibility with the present definition of objectives in ACPT
  (this is also the reason why the <TT>text-action-spec</TT> uses a
  keyword <TT>TITLE</TT>).<LI> There are certain terminals in the grammar that refer to
typologies of elements in the Air Campaign domain. These are:
  <UL><LI> Aspect<LI> State<LI> Geographic-region<LI> Object-type<LI> Action<LI> Action-capability<LI> Time-period
  </UL>
<P>
  The typologies for these elements must be defined in detail within
  an ARPI-wide effort towards a shared ontology. When such typologies
  are defined, it will be possible to define a set of fillers (or a
  more specific grammar) for these items.
<P>
  Independently of these efforts, a more specific grammar will be
  developed shortly for the elements: <TT>Aspect</TT>, <TT>State</TT> and
  <TT>Time-period</TT>, because in the development process these seem to
  require further structuring.<LI> Some terminals presently defined as text must be defined (at
  least in part) campaign- or theater-wise. These are: <TT>Country</TT>
  and <TT>Geographic-region</TT>.<LI> There is currently no structured definition for measures of
  merit. This is one of the priorities for extending this grammar
  later.
<P>

<P>
The following are examples of how some objectives can be represented
in the proposed grammar. They are adapted (substituting country names)
from actual objectives used in IFD-4. The quotes in some elements are
not necessary, and are used for clarity, to emphasize groups of words
that are playing the same grammatical role. Primitive terms of the
grammar are indicated by capital letters. The DOB token is ommitted
for clarity. Some COGs and sequence restrictions were added for
illustration purposes.
