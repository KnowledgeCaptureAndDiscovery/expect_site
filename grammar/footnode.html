  accordance with CHECKMATE usage, the term <em>objectives</em> is used
  in this document meaning any air campaign objective, i.e.  an
  objective in either one of the four basic levels of Air Campaign
  Plans described in ACPT: CINC objectives, air objectives, air tasks
  and air activities.  An <em>air objective</em> is thus only one type
  of objective in air campaign plans.

</PRE><DT><A NAME="79">...others.</A><DD> There are in principle many other temporal relations
  that can be specified between objectives in an air campaign, and
  there are many ontologies of time in AI that specify these in
  detail. However, CHECKMATE experts have pointed out that to allow
  a large set of temporal relations to be used as sequencing
  specifications can be more confusing than helpful. According to
  them, sequence specifications have an inherent vagueness that makes
  useless any attempt to specify them more precisely.
