The Active Templates program (AcT) will produce a robust, lightweight software technology for aiding in the automation of
detailed planning and execution for military operations and other highly-coordinated activities using a plan spreadsheet
metaphor. Active Templates are distributed data structures whose variables will be linked to live data feeds or
problem-solving methods. Active Templates will assist with automated planning and execution by capturing, improving and
updating critical information such as current state, goals, constraints, alternative actions, standard defaults,
problem-solving context over time, decisions, and rationale. Active Templates will be designed to be user-tailorable,
networked, noise-tolerant, user-supported, scalable and widely adopted. 

<P>Within AcT, the <B>TEMPLE</B> project is developing software tools to aid a user in adding new constraints to active
templates. This work makes use of prior work on problem-solving methods and script-based acquisition for plan evaluation
performed under HPKB and ARPI.
