<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
<B>INSPECT</b> is a plan evaluation tool that was built using the EXPECT framework to develop knowledge-based systems. INSPECT was initially developed as part of the work that the EXPECT project is doing under the the DARPA/Rome Laboratory Planning Initiative (ARPI) to create tools that support the US military in developing air campaigns. INSPECT is now being extended in several important dimensions under the DARPA JFACC program. 
<P>
<b>INSPECT</b> takes an air campaign plan that has been manually developed and looks for possible problems that a user may have overlooked, such as inconsistencies or unrealistic use of resources. An important part of the work on INSPECT was the development of structured representations (or grammars) for air campaign plans. 
<P>
<b>INSPECT</b> was an integral part of two important demonstrations: ARPI's Fourth Integrated Feasibility Demonstration (IFD-4) in June 1996 and the Jumpstart Demonstration of the DARPA JFACC program in January 1997
