<p/>Start with the Login Screen.
Currently there is no password required, which might result in you seeing
other people's statements or vice versa.
<p/><img src="demoimages/imageRD5.JPG" height="768" width="1024"/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p/>After logging in, you
are presented with the purposes which you have (or a person with your login
ID has) made so far. By default, there are 3 purposes which are added for
each new user.
<p/><img src="demoimages/imageRP6.JPG" height="768" width="1024"/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p/>You can make a new purpose
by the "New Purpose" button, which prompts for the name of the new purpose
<p/><img src="demoimages/imageQJJ.JPG" height="768" width="1024"/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p/>After creating a new purpose
OR when editing an existing purpose, you end up with the editor window
as shown.
<br/>A query frame is seen,
in which you can fire off queries (basically queries the Google search
engine), and get the results in the results frame below.
<br/>There is nothing in the
current selections here, since this is a new purpose. Nor is there anything
in the statements frame.
<p/><img src="demoimages/image7GI.JPG" height="768" width="1024"/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p/>You can add one (or more)
of the results, which turn up in the results frame by selecting them and
clicking 'Add Selections'.
<p/><img src="demoimages/imageCPO.JPG" height="768" width="1024"/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p/>These result titles can
also be renamed, by selecting it and pressing Ren (one of the buttons for
editing of current selections), or Deleted, or moved to the Statements
frame.
<p/><img src="demoimages/imageGEQ.JPG" height="768" width="1024"/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p/>You can also add user
data (i.e. manually enter text, title, and a referring url (if any))
<p/><img src="demoimages/imageTGQ.JPG" height="768" width="1024"/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p/>If you think one of the
web sources can act as a source in a statement, you can describe it further
by the 'Desc' button as shown. This data will show up whenever this source
is clicked.
<p/><img src="demoimages/imageF1O.JPG" height="768" width="1024"/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p/>You can view a user data
by clicking on it.
<p/><img src="demoimages/image3MG.JPG" height="768" width="1024"/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p/>To edit the user data,
just click the Edit button and enter the new data
<p/><img src="demoimages/imageFTV.JPG" height="768" width="1024"/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p/>You can make a statement
about the web sources thus collected (current selections) by clicking the
"Add Unit" button. The "Unit" implies a "Statement".
<p/><img src="demoimages/imageQLE.JPG" height="768" width="1024"/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p/>The Statement shows up
like a collapsible list. If any Sub-Units are added after selecting this
statement, they will be added under this statement in the collapsible tree.
<p/><img src="demoimages/imageOEU.JPG" height="768" width="1024"/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p/>A shortcut to the above
process of collecting sources and making statements is to "Import" statements
from other users (if they have made any)
<br/>After the Import window
opens, you can search for the particular keyword (here 'Iraq') in either
Purpose names or even comprising Statements.
<p/><img src="demoimages/imageKD4.JPG" height="768" width="1024"/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p/>Clicking on a purpose
shows an uneditable version of the user's statements. You can select a
statement and import it.
<p/><img src="demoimages/imageVV3.JPG" height="768" width="1024"/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p/>After importing, the statement
(along with the substatements) as well as the sources are added to your
own set.
<p/><img src="demoimages/image270.JPG" height="768" width="1024"/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p/>You can also rearrange
the statements by dragging and dropping like shown. A black line shows
the position where the statement is going to end up at. A transparent box
shows within which statement this statement is going to end up. (So you
can either drag to, or into).
<br/>There are 2 modes of
dragging : Left-click and drag drags the whole tree (as shown), and right
click and drag just drags the particular statement.
<p/><img src="demoimages/imageCE4.JPG" height="768" width="1024"/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p/>After dragging:
<p/><img src="demoimages/imageF1H.JPG" height="768" width="1024"/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p/>You also have a 'Toggle'
button used for offline work. Select a statement and click 'Toggle'. This
link now points to the cached copy. A link pointing to a cached copy is
highlighted in a darker green colour. [ Note that Toggling is still Beta,
so it might cause some trouble ;-( ]
<p/><img src="demoimages/imageTQT.JPG" height="768" width="1024"/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p/>You can also move certain
selections to the right by the 'Move->' button. These selections go under
a 'Notes and other information' category.
<p/><img src="demoimages/imageTLJ.JPG" height="768" width="1024"/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p/>The Edit button is used
to edit/change an existing statement.
<br/>The Remove button is
self explanatory. You can select a statement and click 'Remove' to remove
the statement and all it's sub statements.
<br/>The Restore button is
used as a single 'Undo'.
<br/>The Extract button is
used after selecting a statement. Then all the sources that it finds inside
the statement are added to the current selections.
<br/>
<br/>
<p/>Going back to the Main
Screen, you can see the Markedup versions of the purposes that were just
edited, by clicking on the 'XML' button for the XML markup, 'RDF' button
for RDF markup and 'DAML' button for the DAML version.
<br/>In this example, the
XML version of the 'Use of chemical weapons by Iraq' purpose is shown:
<p/><img src="demoimages/imageLS3.JPG" height="768" width="1024"/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p/>You can also see the Schemas
(DTD, XMLSchema) for the XML instance and RDFSchema for the RDF document,
as well as the DAML ontology for Trellis by clicking the respective buttons
on top of the screen.
<p/><img src="demoimages/imageRP7.JPG" height="768" width="1024"/>
<br/>
<p/>The 'Save' Button is used
to take a single backup of all your purposes. If at a later time, the 'Restore'
button is clicked, all the purposes from the time that 'Save' was clicked
are restored.
<br/>The 'Help' Button br/ings
up a user guide in html format.
<br/>The 'Logout' Button br/ings
you back to the Starting Login page.
