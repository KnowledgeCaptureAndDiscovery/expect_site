<H2>Description</H2>
<P>    	   	 
<B>TRELLIS</B> is new kind of software which is very useful when building a knowledge base.
<B>TRELLIS</B> stores and extracts knowledge through a special "semantic vocabulary", and
is easily updatable with new knowledge, even
by novice users, via an intuitive step-by-step user interface.
<B>TRELLIS</B> was especially designed to annotate analyses and
conclusions made by people and computers, so that they may be reviewed and
updated.   	     
<P>	   	     
<B>TRELLIS</B> is developed under the <A HREF='http://www.isi.edu/expect'><B>EXPECT</B></A> project.

Why is <B>TRELLIS</B> different from other knowledge bases? Well!
<UL>		     
<LI>It knows how a user identified or derived key information;
 why, and in what context it was found salient.
<LI>It uses interdependency annotations to link and describe the
 relationships between different pieces of information, e.g. "consistent
 with", "contradicted by", "dismissed by", "supported by", "elaborated
in", etc.	     
<LI>It uses The <A href='http://www.dublincore.org'>Dublic Core Metadata Initiative</A>
  for document annotations.
<LI>It uses <A href='http://www.w3.org/XML/'>XML</A> and
 <A href='http://www.w3.org/RDF/'>RDF</A> (soon
 <A href='http://www.daml.org/2001/03/daml+oil-index'>DAML+OIL</A>!) to
 store its data, which is easily read by humans and easily exported to other systems.
<LI>Users may add domain-specific annotations.
<LI>Users may point to other information sources, e.g. the internet.
<LI>It automatically traces the annotations for an analysis and
conclusion.	     
<LI>It supports collaboration, tracking annotations made by many users.
