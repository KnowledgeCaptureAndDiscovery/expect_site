<p>
<b>Main Research Themes</b>
</p>
    
    Our work concentrates on several research themes nad are motivated by 
    a number of <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">user studies</a>
    that we have conducted:
       <ul> 
            <li> <b>How can we help users handle the formal representations that our systems use?</b>
            Building on past research on natural language generation, we have developed an
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">English-based editor</a> that allows
            users to select meaningful strings of a paraphrase and search the knowledge
            base for sensible alternative replacements.
            </li>

            <li> How do users know they are doing the right thing?  
            When a system understands how each individual piece of knowledge relates to others
            then it can figure out how new knowledge fits, and can figure out how to interact
            with the user when new knowledge is inconsistent or when other necessary knowledge 
            is missing.  Our approach is to build acquisition interfaces that can
            automatically derive Interdependency Models from a knowledge base and use them to 
            guide the acquisition dialogue.  
            We used this approach in
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">EXPECT</a>,
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">EMeD (EXPECT's Method Editor)</a>,
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">KANAL</a>, and
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">KAMM</a>.
            </li>

            <li> <b>How can we help users make complex modifications to a knowledge 
            base that require many related small changes?</b>
            We have developed dialogue planning tools that represent
            typical sequences of changes that users make and use them to
            dynamically generate follow-up questions to users.  
            We used this approach in
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">KA Scripts</a>,
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">PSMTool/Constable</a>, and
            our new work on
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">KASPER</a>.
            </li>
            
            <li> <b>How can we help users figure out where to start?</b>
            Because it is hard for users to start entering knowledge
            from scratch, we assume that the system has some 
            general background knowledge that the user populates 
            with domain-specific information.
            We have built several declarative domain theories for this
            purpose, including
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">PLANET (a PLAn semantic NET)</a> and
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">plan evaluation</a>.
            </li>            

            <li> <b>How can a user turn informal and possibly disconnected information
            into increasingly more formalized and operational knowledge?</b>
	    A new research area is on tools to develop 
            <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">
		Resilient Hyper Knowledge Bases (RHKBs)</a>,
		which capture the rationale and development of knowledge
                bases from the original sources of information used.
		These tools will guide users step by step to 
		create increasingly more formal representations of knowledge.
		We are using some natural language processing techniques
		to help users enter knowledge from textual sources.
             <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web/trellis">TRELLIS</a> 
             is a first step in this direction.

    <li> When users are not AI experts, what kinds of help do they need to 
    teach new knowledge to an intelligent system?
    We have conducted a number of <a href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/web">user studies</a>
    and some of the central problems we found are:
