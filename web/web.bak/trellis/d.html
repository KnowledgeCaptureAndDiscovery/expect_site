<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>A Screen Walkthrough
Demonstration of TRELLIS</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Version 1.0, August 2001</font></b></center>

<p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Brief Overview</font></i></b>
<p>TRELLIS is an interactive environment that will allow users to add their
observations, viewpoints, and conclusions as they analyze information by
making semantic annotations to documents and other on-line resources. We
view this as a knowledge acquisition problem, where users are adding new
knowledge to the system based on their expertise as they analyze information.
<p>TRELLIS can be accessed from the main project page at http://www.trellis.semanticweb.org,
or from http:www.isi.edu/expect/projects/trellis.
<p>Each analysis that the user performs has a purpose that is used to describe
the issue analyzed.&nbsp; TRELLIS asks the user to specify a purpose, which
is a short sentence that summarizes the issue or hypothesis in question.
<p>Each piece of information or data that is used in the analysis is called
a statement.&nbsp; A statement can be linked to a Web resource, it could
be a manual or authoritative source.&nbsp; TRELLIS allows the user to access
a Web search engine and use the results of the search to create new statements.&nbsp;
Users can also enter statements that are not Web pages but instead have
text such as an email message, or a note about a conversation, or any other
text.&nbsp; The user can specify a URL but it is not necessary.&nbsp; In
addition to input information and data, the user can add statements that
indicate intermediate conclusions or hypothesis.&nbsp; Statements can also
be used to indicate the sources of some information.&nbsp; Sources can
be qualified according to the user's view on their reliability and credibility.&nbsp;
The user can define new statements or modify existing ones at any time.
<p>The overall analysis is composed of units, which are composed in turn
of sub-units.&nbsp; Each unit relates individual statements using a construct
from the TRELLIS vocabulary. All the statements within a unit are linked
to some Web source or user-provided text.&nbsp; Users can provide reasons
("because…") or not, depending on the amount of detail that they wish to
capture in each part of the analysis.&nbsp; Only some portions of a given
unit are part of the TRELLIS language.&nbsp; The rest of the components
of the unit (i.e., the statements) are treated as strings and TRELLIS will
not process them further.
<br>At any time, users can compose their analysis from the statements that
they have selected and created.&nbsp; The analysis of a purpose is made
of units, which may have sub-units in turn.&nbsp; Users can collapse or
expand any portions of the analysis and manipulate units and sub-units
to refine their interdependencies. Users can also rearrange the units in
the analysis by dragging and dropping them in the analysis window.&nbsp;
This is useful in cases where the analysis is done bottom-up and the users
wants to relate units that were created previously separately.
<p>Sometimes a user does not know yet how to use a statement in an analysis
but would like to have that statement included in the analysis frame.&nbsp;
Users can select statements and include them in the analysis under a 'Notes
and other information' category.&nbsp; This facility is also useful to
drag and drop statements into the analysis.
<p>Users can also import statements and units from other users if they
are relevant to your purpose.&nbsp; The user can do keyword search in either
purpose names or statement titles entered by other users.
<p>TRELLIS can be used offline if you cache Web pages before disconnecting
from the network. Statements can be selected and a cached copy of their
corresponding Web pages is created and used until otherwise indicated.
<p>Users can view the results of their analysis annotated in several markup
languages: XML, RDF, and DAML, corresponding to the Schemas and ontologies
that define the TRELLIS vocabulary.

<p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Screen Walkthrough of an Example</font></i></b>
<br><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></i></b>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Start with the Login Screen.</font></font></b>
<p><img SRC="imageRD5.JPG" height=768 width=1024>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Each analysis that the
user performs has a "purpose" that is used to describe the issue analyzed.&nbsp;
After logging in, you are presented with the purposes which you have (or
a person with your login ID has) made so far. By default, there are 3 purposes
which are added for each new user.</font></font></b>
<p><img SRC="imageRP6.JPG" height=768 width=1024>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>You can make a new purpose
by the "New Purpose" button, which prompts for the name of the new purpose</font></font></b>
<p><img SRC="imageQJJ.JPG" height=768 width=1024>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>After creating a new purpose
OR when editing an existing purpose, you end up with the <i><u>purpose
editor window </u></i>as shown below. The left side of the screen is used
to find, select, and edit the statements used in analyzing the purpose.&nbsp;
The right side of the screen is used to construct and view the details
of the analysis.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A <i><u>query frame</u></i>
is in the top left hand side, in which you can fire off queries to a search
engine (in this version of TRELLIS the search engine is Google), and get
the results in the <i><u>results frame</u></i> below.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>There is nothing in the
current selections here, since this is a new purpose. Nor is there anything
in the <i><u>statements frame</u></i>, which is the frame shown in the
lower left of the screen</font></font></b>
<p><img SRC="image7GI.JPG" height=768 width=1024>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The results from the search
engine that you find relevant can be selected by clicking their icon and
clicking on 'Add Selections'.&nbsp; The Web pages selected are added to
the statements frame at the bottom left.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font></b>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="imageCPO.JPG" height=768 width=1024>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The selected pages can
be renamed to reflect the salient fact that they contain that needs to
be brought up in the analysis of the overall purpose.&nbsp; You can rename
something by selecting it and pressing Ren (one of the buttons for editing
of current selections).&nbsp; A selected page can also be deleted (selecting
it and then clicking on the Delete button).&nbsp; Anything in the statements
frame can also be moved to the analysis frame on the right hand side to
start building the analysis (by selecting it and clicking the "Move ->"
button).</font></font></b>
<p><img SRC="imageGEQ.JPG" height=768 width=1024>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Not all statements come
from Web pages.&nbsp; You can also add new statements manually, for example
an email message, or a note about a conversation, or any other text.&nbsp;
This is done by clicking on "Add user data".&nbsp; You can specify a URL
if you wish, but it is not necessary.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Any new statements entered
manually also have to be selected in order to be added to the statements
frame and ultimately to the analysis.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font></b>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="imageTGQ.JPG" height=768 width=1024>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Some statements denote
a source (e.g., CNN) that you want to cite in your analysis.&nbsp; You
can describe a source in detail using the 'Desc' button as shown. This
description will be shown whenever you click on this source statement.</font></font></b>
<p><img SRC="imageF1O.JPG" height=768 width=1024>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>You can also view user-entered
statements by clicking on them.</font></font></b>
<p><img SRC="image3MG.JPG" height=768 width=1024>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>To modify a user-entered
statement, select it and click on the Edit button, then enter the new information.</font></font></b>
<p><img SRC="imageFTV.JPG" height=768 width=1024>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>At any time, you can compose
your analysis from the statements that you have selected and created.&nbsp;
The analysis of a purpose is made of units, which may have sub-units in
turn.&nbsp; Click the "Add Unit" button, where you can select statements
and constructs from the TRELLIS language in order to create an expression.&nbsp;
You can also annotate the source of the analysis and qualify the source
for its reliability and credibility.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>You can build a unit using
the default TRELLIS constructs, but you can also define your own by selecting
"New".</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font></b>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="imageQLE.JPG" height=768 width=1024>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Units are normally shown
as a collapsible list that the user can select and expand. If any sub-units
are added after selecting a statement, they will be added under this statement
in the collapsible tree.</font></font></b>
<p><img SRC="imageOEU.JPG" height=768 width=1024>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>You can also use statements
and units from other users if they are relevant to your purpose.&nbsp;
To do this, click on the "Import" button and you will be prompted for a
keyword to search (here 'Iraq') in either Purpose names or Statement titles
entered by other users.</font></font></b>
<p><img SRC="imageKD4.JPG" height=768 width=1024>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>From the results obtained,
you can select a purpose.&nbsp; The system will show an uneditable version
of the analysis frame. You can select any unit and import it.&nbsp; Notice
that if you select the top unit the entire analysis is imported.</font></font></b>
<p><img SRC="imageVV3.JPG" height=768 width=1024>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>After importing, the selected
units and sub-units (along with the statements used in them) as well as
the sources are added to your own set.</font></font></b>
<p><img SRC="image270.JPG" height=768 width=1024>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>You can also rearrange
the units in the analysis by dragging and dropping them in the analysis
frame.&nbsp; This is useful if you do your analysis bottom-up and want
to relate units that you created previously separately.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>To move a unit, select
it first by moving the mouse to the left side of the triangle widget and
clicking on it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hold down the mouse and move it to the place
where you want the unit to be.&nbsp; A black line shows the position where
the unit would be dropped.&nbsp; A transparent box shows its future parent
unit. (So you can either drag to, or into).</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>There are 2 modes of dragging
: Left-click and drag drags the whole tree (as shown), and right click
and drag just drags the particular unit.</font></font></b>
