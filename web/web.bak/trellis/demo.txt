<P><B>The Demo</B>
<P>The initial screen of the web interface. I log myself in...
<P><IMG WIDTH='640' HEIGHT='480' SRC='1.jpg'>
<P>Add a new purpose...
<P><IMG WIDTH='640' HEIGHT='480' SRC='2.jpg'>
<P>And <B>TRELLIS</B> uses Google to start me off with some supporting elements.
<P><IMG WIDTH='640' HEIGHT='480' SRC='3.jpg'>
<P>I liked one of the Google results and added it to my elements.
<P><IMG WIDTH='640' HEIGHT='480' SRC='4.jpg'>
<P>Here's that page.
<P><IMG WIDTH='640' HEIGHT='480' SRC='5.jpg'>
<P>I add an entry into the statements box for this page, to be used later.
<P><IMG WIDTH='640' HEIGHT='480' SRC='6.jpg'>
<P>Huh. This is what my calculator says about the square root of 2.
<P><IMG WIDTH='640' HEIGHT='480' SRC='7.jpg'>
<P>So I added my own element about the calculator's opinion, and added a statement about that.
<P><IMG WIDTH='640' HEIGHT='480' SRC='8.jpg'>
<P>Now I add a unit to describe the relationship between those statements. This unit is a statement also, and can be used as a source statement in future statements.
I've decided that my calculator supports what I found on the web, although it didn't
find as many digits!
<P><IMG WIDTH='640' HEIGHT='480' SRC='9.jpg'>
<P>My unit is now in the statements window. That's my conclusion!
<P><IMG WIDTH='640' HEIGHT='480' SRC='10.jpg'>
<P>Full-functioning web demo coming soon.
