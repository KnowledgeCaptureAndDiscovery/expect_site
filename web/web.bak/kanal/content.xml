  <title>Knowledge Analysis on Process Models"</title>

  <status>
   <b><n /></b> is a tool for building and checking process models.  By
relating different pieces of information in process models among themselves
and to the existing KB, it performs a variety of verification and validation
checks and propose useful fixes.
  <p />

We performed an initial evaluation in December 2000, which has been reported in
<a 
href="http://www.isi.edu/expect/projects/rkf/KANAL/kanal-ijcai01.pdf">Kim and
Gil, IJCAI-01</a>.  The results show that <n /> can find most of the errors in
the process models and suggest useful fixes including the fixes that directly
point to the sources of the errors.
<p />

<n /> has been successfully integrated within an end-to-end system (called
SHAKEN) that supports subject matter experts entering domain knowledge as part
of the DARPA <a href="http://reliant.teknowledge.com/RKF/">Rapid Knowledge
Formation (RKF)</a> program.  During summer 2001, the SHAKEN system has been
evaluated by lightly trained biologists where they author biology textbook
knowledge using the system.  The resulting knowledge bases 
answer questions that a student might be asked based on the
chapter's contents.
